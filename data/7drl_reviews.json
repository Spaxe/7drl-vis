You take damage from enemy cannons both in lost crew and in hull damage, but start with more than enough men that chances are you will sink long before that's a problem. You can try to run away from a fight for repairs, but the one time I tried that, every ship on the map ended up on my tail, so it's probably not much more conducive to long-term survival than a more head-on approach.\n\nThe game is real-time, but pausable and speedupable.

You're a goblin in command of a bunch of monsters, and you have to defend your village from the \"deratization\" (aka pest control) squad.

You can also right-click to place an obstacle. Each of these actions can be performed a limited number of times per level.\n\nIt's an interesting concept, but unfortunately the gameplay is a bit bland. There aren't any items or spells to use, so it's just running around fighting stuff, ordering your minions, and placing obstacles. There are a number of minor bugs, but one major one I encountered (unless I just missed something obvious) is that sometimes a level will be generated with enemies that are out of reach - perhaps inside a sealed building?

    "c": 3,
    "reviewText": "Anti-ratization is basically a series of combat arenas in which you and some AI-controlled allies take on a succession of invading forces. The premise here is that you’re a goblin and you’re orchestrating the defence of the basement lair where you live with goblin and orc buddies against human attempts to clear it out. Initially I mistakenly thought that all I could do was run around, killing enemies myself and hoping that some of them strayed close enough to the milling orcs and goblins to get their attention, but there’s actually a little bit more to it. \n\nA lot of 7DRLs wisely focus on trying to introduce one or two interesting mechanics to an otherwise unremarkable formula, and Anti-deratization takes this approach too. The mechanics here are Shouts and Resources. While movement and basic ‘bump to hit’ combat is controlled with the keyboard, you Shouts and Resources are deployed with the mouse (I found this led to me awkwardly shifting my right hand back and forth between numpad and mouse but it’s not a big problem). The Shouts are the more useful of the two, allowing you to send all your allies to the vicinity where you left-clicked. The key feature that stops this being mundane is that you have only ten Shouts per level, so you have to avoid being careless with them. If you run out, you have to rely on your own attacks alone, or try to bait enemies towards your allies. It’s not an earth-shattering innovation but it is something we don’t often see in roguelikes, and the limited uses are a good idea. \n\nThe other mechanic is Resources, which is basically a (similarly limited) collection of blocks you can throw down by right clicking. It’s not clear what they’re meant to be, though each one seems to be represented by a randomly chosen symbol. I’m not a huge fan of this mechanic here, because it doesn’t do much. Some of these blocks seem to do nothing (I was able to repeatedly walk over one type, and one type only) and when they work they have limited applications. The levels are generally pretty open, so being able to place eight single blocks doesn’t achieve much. I thought about trying to build an enclosure, put my allies inside and wait for enemies to find them, but enemies just mill around aimlessly until they have you in sight, so it could have taken all day. If you’re fleeing and want to block off one of the occasional narrow passages behind you, that works. If you’re taking a lot of projectile fire and want to throw down a barricade, that works (until the enemy sidesteps and shoots round it). For the most part, though, the Resource mechanic doesn’t achieve much and I feel the game would have been much the same without it. \n\nSolid enough presentation - standard libtcod visual style but with an actual graphical title screen, colour scheme makes it easy to distinguish friend from foe, and distinguish everything from the background, though the levels are pretty bare. It’s also always very clear where you’re aiming with the mouse. No bugs or crashes that I noticed, so it all runs pretty well. It’s not a bad game at all but it does get repetitive - clear out all the invaders, the layout re-randomises, then do the same again with increased difficulty. Personally, whenever my goblin eventually died it was usually because I was losing interest and getting sloppy. The Shout mechanic has promise and could be expanded on in interesting ways but Resources are redundant. Worth a try, and some might find longer-lasting enjoyment in it than I did. ",

I was happy to see the element counters described on the help screen, but it would have been even better if the counters were shown directly on the normal UI above each fish stack. As it is now, the help screen needs to be consulted too often. You have to check this game out if only for the fishing mode. It manages to include casting power, fish density, and represents it all nicely in gorgeous ASCII. It's rather amusing to find yourself throwing your lure into a lake of blood and pulling out a vampiric squid. It's also fairly relaxing until you realize enemies are surrounding you while you fish. And once you're surrounded, it can become difficult as you only have 5HP.",

Thus you always want to keep an array of various kinds of fish available to deal with different threats. You can of course run over to a pool and try to fish up some \"ammo\" while enemies are approaching. All throwing attacks have an area of effect, sometimes quite large, and not only are elements within it affected, but the pools inside may be converted to another type as a result.

In between battles you travel from sector to sector visiting allied colonies where you can trade salvage for new/different components. Despite its simplicity, the system is deep as you have to balance crew, engines, weaponry, and components with special functionality. The game starts off fairly easy, but as you defeat enemy bases they concentrate their resources and the number of enemy ships grows, thereby increasing the difficulty. It works quite well and still haven't managed to win despite playing this longer than any other 7DRL so far. It's a quick game to pick up, and each play is fast, since you mostly just concern yourself with buying the right components as you scout all the planets in the most efficient way possible while looking for enemy bases.

The game is feature complete but I was able to find a number of bugs in my hour of play of which the wasd key problem was the greatest followed by not having the down stairs spawn on my last run\n\nAesthetics\nThis I will also be giving a 2. It had music though it got a little repetive at the end so neither here nor there with that. The tiles all looked great though the completely black walls while natural cave looking could have used some color. The game controlled how I expected it for the most part though sometimes the aiming felt sluggish and the fact that the cursor could go off screen was annoying. Also a niggling problem was that while it seemed to be context sensitive it could have done it better, if there isn't an enemy on screen I don't need to shoot fire and if the grave was already looted I don't need the option to loot it anymore\n\nFun\nFollowing the pattern this is another score of 2. I enjoyed it and if you already have python and pygames in go play it. To really stand out it could have used a score board as otherwise gold means nothing but once I stopped collecting it the game was actually funner to play. While you may only have one attack and its the same one the enemies have the game is tactical in a good way.\n\nInnovative\nGoing with a 1 for this. While the game is completely ranged its the same attack, there are 3 enemy types but they all have your attack as well and the only real difference I could notice was HP and XP. The most interesting part was that you can shoot through walls and while interesting its not innovative.\n\nScale\nWeighing in at a score of 2 it works just fine. This game fits perfectly into what I think a normal person can complete in 7 days. Combined with a person to do art for it I think while it might not have gotten to the stars it reached a nice stable orbit.\n\nRoguelikeishness\n3. This is a Roguelike to its core, while it suffered in Innovative because of it somewhat I don't think its a bad thing and it does what it means to so it works.\n\nWrap up\nI enjoyed it. It was a good hour that I spent and as long as the game is worth the hour I see no reason not to play it.",

The characters on the other hand look quite nice (the main character's crab hands looks a bit odd though). A visual nitpick: the level description text is behind enemy sprites. The music is a nice touch, but gets a tad repetitive.\n\nI'm afraid I don't like the controls at all. With a gamepad, it might work a lot better, but using a keyboard is a pain. There are no bump attacks, only a single ranged fireball attack. Attacking an enemy once requires 3 button presses and that doesn't even include as many as 17 key presses to move the target into place (you can attack any enemy on screen.... you can actually attack any enemy off screen for that matter). So killing a single enemy who takes 3 hits can take up 60 key presses in the worst case. That's.... ridiculous.

The maze is littered with colored tiles and colored squares. Stepping on a colored square or pressing \"R\" \"G\" or \"B\" will change all \"neutral\" tiles to the corresponding color. Your white Square can't move from a tile with one color to a tile of another color. You are given 30 moves to start with, and each completed maze grants ten additional moves. Each maze is roughly 10 x 10. Given the choice of colors, ColourBlind's title isn't so much a theme for the game as a cruel joke on those afflicted games.\n\nOverall it is a well put together game that lacks deep content. The easiest way to solve a maze is to step from colored square to colored square as they all sit on neutral tiles and only avoid using RGB to color change as it costs several moves.",

    "reviewText": "Reviewing Crime Central took a while, not because it’s complex or deep but because I wanted to do my best to understand what was going on before sitting down to write the review. I’m still not 100% sure if I’ve understood it correctly but after several hours I don’t think I’m getting anywhere. \n\nThe premise is that you’re a Judge Dredd-like enforcer, roaming in a turn-based first-person environment using WASD, and taking down legions of criminals. As far as I’ve got I’ve only seen one type of criminal and the main thing they do is keep pace with you, so there doesn’t seem to be much variety in these nefarious hordes. You have two resources with which to take down your foes - bullets and bullhorns. Shooting an enemy is straightforward (though performed with Z, which is pretty awkward) and one hit will lay them out. The problem is that you only have six bullets, and usually significantly more targets than that. The game informs you that you can regain ammunition by shooting enemies who have surrendered, which is where bullhorns come in...and this is where it becomes fiddly to explain. \n\nYou start with two bullhorns, and when you use one it causes nearby enemies to drop to their knees in surrender. If you shoot an enemy while he’s on his knees you sometimes regain bullets back up to your maximum of six - ‘sometimes’ being the important word here. More on that later. The other thing you can do with a surrendering enemy is arrest him, and this restores some of your lost health, if any. Bullhorns are absolutely essential to dealing with the multitude of enemies in each level, but the big problem is how you earn more bullhorns. You see, two horns won’t last very long. If you use one and then move, everyone who kneeled in surrender will be back up on their feet and fighting again once you’ve moved. If you shoot, you can usually get off two shots before everyone leaps back to their feet. In order to get a new bullhorn for future use, you have to kill three enemies (arresting them doesn’t seem to count towards new bullhorns) but each kill uses a bullet. This isn’t an issue if one of the bullhorned kills restores your ammo, but they don’t always. You’re at the mercy of the RNG. This means the game becomes a matter of trying to balance out bullet use and bullet regain through careful use of the bullhorns. It’s actually not a bad mechanic but it’s just not very fun here, and this is for two reasons - firstly the RNG, and secondly movement. \n\nAs I said, sometimes the RNG dictates that you won’t get a bullet refill. The game makes you balance your shots against your bullhorns as precisely as possible for maximum efficacy, and then betrays you by not giving you a refill, at which point the game is basically over. Movement, though, is perhaps a bigger problem. I said earlier that the main thing the enemies do is keep pace with you, and that’s the main issue with the movement. Considering how much the game centres around manoeuvring into an advantageous position from which you can shoot the right number of enemies, it’s surprisingly often impossible to do so. If an enemy is a space or two away from you, it will often just mirror you, moving from side to side to block you if you try to manoeuvre around it. This is the other reason that the game is basically over once you run out of bullets. The aim seems to be to get to each level’s exit rather than to eliminate all the enemies, but doing so can be a huge ordeal, and without bullets it’s often completely impossible. Even with bullets I failed to do this more often than not. I don’t think I ever got beyond level 4 and usually not beyond level 2 or even level 1. \n\nThis is the game’s downfall. If it’s going to demand precise use of your tools and mathematical conservation of resources, then it needs manoeuvrability to make that possible. Alternatively, if it’s going to lumber you with inability to manoeuvre, then it needs to be more forgiving in the bullet/bullhorn balance. Sadly, Crime Central does neither and as such ends up wasting a promising mechanic on a game that is too frustrating to be any fun. It’s worth a brief visit to witness the potential for a good mechanic but otherwise leave it alone. ",

    "reviewText": "In Crime Central, you're sent to Penal Colony ND-143X to quell an inmate uprising. You have a few abilities: shooting, arresting, and sprinting. The challenge is that resources are extremely tight and there are no refills. Replenishing your supplies requires specific sequences of actions.\n\nThis is actually a great idea on paper and sometimes it feels like a fun puzzle. Unfortunately, the  mechanics are really confusing.  For example, ammo can be restocked only by doing the following in order 1) letting an enemy hit you, 2) using a bullhorn, and 3) shooting that enemy. Another reviewer came to the erroneous conclusion that the bullet refill was determined randomly (probably because the first step is never explained properly).\n\nFurthermore, there's pretty much a single optimal strategy with little room for error or experimentation. I'm going to explain the strategy, so consider this your ***SPOILER WARNING***:\n\n1) Start by switching to your shotgun with E. This feature is completely undocumented, but is necessary to properly handle Enforcers, which take two revolver hits. Both guns use up the same ammo, even though they have different ammo icons. This is quite weird.\n2) Shoot 5 enemies.\n3) Get hit, bullhorn, arrest. After doing Steps 2-3, you will be back where you started with max ammo, -1 HP, and +1 bullhorn.\n4) Repeat Steps 2-3 until you are nearly out of health.\n5) Use the 3 bullhorns to arrest 3 enemies. You will now have full health and probably just as many bullhorns as you started with.\n\nUsing this strategy, I did beat the game, but only after 60 attempts.\n\nSee, the extremely frustrating thing is you never get out of this cycle. You never get better. You never stockpile resources. If you divert from this strategy even slightly, you lose. Use your last bullet WITHOUT restocking? You're out of ammo forever. Use your last bullhorn with fewer than 4 bullets. You're screwed. You would think arresting multiple enemies using 1 bullhorn would be a good strategy, but the enemy AI never surrounds you...\n\nI guess the reason I wrote all this up is because I think the system has a lot of promise but is currently way too constrained to be much fun. The music, sound, and graphics are all solid; with some changes to the mechanics, the game could be really great.",

The first time I played I didn’t bother reading and consequently thought I was just bashing stuff and sometimes the floor was changing colour for no reason. Read! Like a lot of the best designed games, DataQueen is simple but deep. Floor tiles turn green when you step on them, and you have to link the pink tiles together by connecting them all with green ones. There are enemies with various special properties trying to stop you, but they can only move when you step on a neutral tile (i.e. not green or pink). They don’t attack you but they do neutralise your green tiles and can kill you if they completely surround you. That’s the gist of it, and it leads to a surprisingly tactical game experience. Using your ‘free’ movement across the green tiles, choosing where to take a step onto neutral tiles, and trying to bait the enemy swarms into suitable positions takes a lot of thought at times. \n\nTo add to this, your attacks are tied to the ability wheel in the corner of the screen. You can only use a particular ability in the direction indicated on the wheel. When a turn passes, the wheel rotates and the directions in which you can use your abilities change. The whole game becomes about positioning and careful use of turns. It’s challenging and probably a bit on the tough side, but I find that never it gets frustrating or feels unfair. I’m usually bad at tactical games but DataQueen keeps drawing me back in by remaining accessible and giving the impression that you can always win if you just think carefully enough. \n\nAlso well presented and polished, nice to look at, has minimal but appropriate sound effects, and includes unlockable/upgradeable abilities between levels. Definitely one of my top 7DRL picks this year. ",

It's harder than it sounds since you have to take into account all their special abilities, and your own abilities only work in certain directions (which rotate with every move). The game plays out on a hex grid, which is perfect for this kind of game; four-way movement would have been too boring, and eight-way would be too easy. While not exactly intuitive at first, as long as you put in the time to read the help and tool tips, and play through a level, it'll all fall into place. Then the fun really begins. Great game.

    "ft": "Running around a fast-paced hack-n-slash is always entertaining, but that gives way quickly to frustration if it's impossible to leave the first room.  The game mechanic is a series of rooms with numbered bosses, each of which stays still and spawns smaller minions one by one that attack you.  The minions are easy, the bosses are hard.  In this case, it seems that to defeat the first room's exit boss you have to either side-step around him using undocumented keys, or wait until he's sent enough enemies at you that you've levelled up enough to take him on.  Unfortunately, after the third game restart, this becomes quite a chore, and by the time you've done this twenty times it's fairly frustrating.  There seems to be no real way to accelerate your progress, and a roguelike really shouldn't be about waiting in realtime for new enemies to spawn.  It's possible to progress a great deal just by leaving your browser running and letting the smaller monsters dash themselves hopelessly against you, but even this strategy only works so far - I gave up after levelling up to level 12 by this technique (around half an hour's play) only to be one-shotted by an invincible kobold i couldn't run away from in the last room.

    "reviewText": "Golden Krone Hotel does basically what I expect from most 7DRLs in terms of gameplay - it’s readily identifiable as a roguelike but with some additional features or twists that make it its own game. Control is straightforward, just WASD to move and a few keyboard shortcuts (numbers for spells, P for potions, etc) though I found it much easier to just keep my right hand on the mouse and click the on-screen buttons for these functions. The core distinctive mechanic here is light and, while it’s a good one, the game does almost nothing to explain it. It soon becomes apparent that pools of sunlight appear occasionally as you move around but it’s not clear why. It took me a number of attempts at the game before I realised the light was coming through cracked-looking blue blocks in the walls. (Possibly windows? Though why they admit light only when broken isn’t clear.) It was longer still before I discovered that I could use the seemingly pointless starting spell, Blast, to crack intact blue blocks and thereby let more light in. It was an unreasonably long time (probably about 45 minutes) before I caught on that the pools of light shift as the day progresses and advances to night, then the next day. It must have been over an hour of play time before I realised that the tiny square with a yellow pattern underneath my stats was showing me the direction of the daylight at that moment. \n\nPossibly I was being unusually obtuse but the mechanics are kept very unclear, which actually didn’t bother me by itself. Leaving you to figure things out as you play can work well, and I never felt frustrated by the process in Golden Krone Hotel. The thing that makes me peg this as a deficiency here is the statement on the developer’s blog that the first room is meant as a tutorial (it doesn’t work as one but that’s beside the point). So clearly he intended this mechanic to be apparent upfront, but it really isn’t. The other major mechanic here is that you sometimes becomes a vampire (after a few hours of play I’m still not clear on what causes this). There are ways to temporarily revert but while you’re a vampire humans attack you, and while you’re a human vampires attack you. \n\nThere are plenty of other nice little features. Working out the optimal way to use the spells you can find scattered around, discovering the benefits of lighting and extinguishing torches, and so on - various small touches that add an extra layer of appeal and engagement to the game beyond its core ‘gimmick’. It feels like an adventure, finding any way you can to gain an advantage, because just hitting enemies usually doesn’t work that well. It’s also very well presented, with nice pixel art and bits of music. One final feature I want to note is the way books work. Finding books can have various effects (new spells, fragments of lore, etc) and one effect is to enable you to always recognise a particular type of potion (they all look identical). It’s a nice way of handling potion identification. \n\nI usually dislike browser games but this one is worth playing. I wasn’t blown away by its innovation or floored by its ingenuity, but that’s not necessary. It’s a fun game that does a lot right and very little wrong, and provides a nice variation on the roguelike standards. ",

    "reviewText": "HvZ, or Humans vs. Zombies, does not contain any actual zombies, surprisingly enough. Instead, it's a roguelike simulation of the school campus game of the same name, in which players designated \"zombies\" try to tag players designated \"humans\" (though in this game there is only one human, namely you), while the humans defend themselves with Nerf guns which \"stun\" the zombies.\n\nThe goal of the game is to make it to all your classes on time and safely. You lose if you are tagged by a zombie, or you are late to a class. This sounds simple, but the controls make it surprisingly challenging. Some players may enjoy the challenge; others may find it frustrating. In addition to the normal \"move with the arrow keys\" controls, you can enter \"run mode\", in which the controls behave a bit more like an early FPS - pressing up or down changes your speed, while pressing left or right turns you 45 degrees. This mode allows you to quickly evade zombies (and be warned, they will run at you as well, so you'll need to use it!) but is rather unwieldy to control. You also have a 90 degree FOV cone, but you can hear zombies behind you or to the side provided that they are running.\n\nThe controls for your Nerf gun are surprisingly detailed, too. In order to attack a zombie, you must have a loaded round, cock the gun, and only then can you fire it. If you fire without cocking the gun, the barrel spins harmlessly. If you fire without a round loaded, the same thing happens - and the game tracks individual barrels of your gun, as well as individual ammo pouches!\n\nIt's all rather simulationist, so some players will be turned on by it while others will be turned off. Still, I think it's worth a try, just to see if you enjoy that sort of thing or not! I personally found it a bit too detailed, but then that's just me - I'm sure firearms enthusiasts and hardcore tacticians might have something else to say!",

    "reviewText": "Knight was one of the games I found most intriguing on first play. You control a knight on horseback, who must visit the five castles of the kingdom and find out which of them are still loyal to the king. To this end, you must guide your horse as best you can, and this is really the main part of the gameplay. \n\nMany successful 7DRLs take one neat, new idea and focus on implementing it well rather than overloading themselves with half-executed concepts. The neat idea here is horse movement. It’s all about momentum, with additional direction key presses accelerating your horse from a walk up to a full gallop, via every speed in between. This means that you have to plan ahead a little bit - you can’t just march over to that nearby castle, you have to angle your horse’s arc around the corner and try not to crash into that fence on the far side. It’s an interesting mechanic and, while it was clearly going to take some practice, I looked forward to getting a handle on it. \n\nI did get a handle on it after a while, but that was only the beginning. Being a roguelike, the world isn’t short of hostility. Bandits will shoot at you as you ride by, and some of the lords you visit are disloyal and won’t welcome you with open arms. This isn’t the problem though. The problem is the horse. \n\nIt requires focus and forethought to cross the open countryside. Move slowly and safely, and you risk being attacked more easily by bandits. Zoom past the bandits, and you’ll find it difficult to manoeuvre due to your speed. That’s the easy part though. The horse really becomes a bane when you enter a castle courtyard. \n\nThe courtyard is bustling with people - knights and peasants milling around, wandering by, minding their own business. This looks pretty good, and does evoke the feeling of a working stronghold. Unfortunately, ‘minding their own business’ frequently means ‘diving under a horse’s hooves’. It’s frustratingly, teeth-gnashingly easy to accidentally run over a peasant or other milling layabout while crossing the courtyard. Not only do they not avoid you, they often actively walk right in front of you. It’s perfectly possible to cross the courtyard without mishap, but it means painstakingly taking a tiny step at a time, eyeing everyone around you to see where they’re going, veering off to one side to try and avoid any movements that anyone might make. This rapidly becomes tedious and aggravating, and bear in mind that even if you don’t have an unfortunate accident, you’ll have to do this five times. Why do you have to be so careful? Does a peasant’s misfortune matter? Why, yes. Yes it does. There are painful consequences for you as well as for them if you trample them underfoot, as the guards will immediately declare that your collision is an all-out assault on the castle, and they’ll swarm you and and tear you to pieces in just a few turns.\n\nWhen you have managed to laboriously cross the courtyard, you enter the keep on foot. Movement here is more like a standard roguelike, but bear in mind that an unknown number of these castles are under the sway of disloyal rebel lords, whose troops will attack you without qualm - though only once you’ve reached the far end of the throne room and you’re blocked in by a dozen armed soldiers. This part is another nice idea that doesn’t entirely work. There’s no way you can beat all of the soldiers, so as soon as you discover the lord in question is hostile, all you can do is dodge and weave your way back to the exit, leap onto your horse and obliviously charge back across the courtyard, heedless of the peasants and guards you’re squishing underfoot. They are now the lackeys of the enemy! \n\nThat’s pretty fun. It’s nice that the only option is to flee, and the contrast between your careful entrance and your full-tilt, guard-squashing exit makes your escape feel exhilarating. Sadly, it’s then on to another castle to repeat the tedious courtyard creep, and potentially the 50-50 chance of escaping the throne room, if it’s another rebel castle. \n\nAll in all, I like Knight’s ideas. The movement mechanic is intriguing and I like the careful arrival followed by headlong flight. The problems outweigh this fun though, and sadly these problems revolve around the very mechanic that makes this game novel. Crossing the courtyard safely is just too difficult. Even after many, many attempts I still had probably a 1 in 10 chance, maybe less, of avoiding trample passers-by, which is effectively an instant game over. This means that despite it’s good ideas, Knight is afflicted with that awkward one-two punch of being both frustrating and tedious. I can easily recommend giving it a try once for the ‘ooh, that’s interesting’ factor of the movement mechanic, but I can’t recommend actually sitting and playing it for fun. Good ideas but they just don’t work very well here. Perhaps another time...",

    "reviewText": "When I first played Kunoichi I was pleasantly surprised, shortly followed by unpleasantly disappointed. That changed when I came back to it for review purposes, though. The most striking thing about the game, and arguably its best feature, is presentation. In keeping with its historical Japanese theme (a kunoichi is, I believe, a female ninja) the visuals consist of kanji characters rather than ASCII, which is not only a nice thematic touch but also surprisingly effective for gameplay. Unlike a similar endeavour by a game called Goblin Men to use Chinese characters, Kunoichi doesn’t look cluttered or confusing. I don’t know whether the kanji characters accurately describe the features they represent (e.g. whether a door is represented by the kanji for ‘door’) but regardless, each symbol looks sufficiently different from the others to make it easy to parse what’s going on. This is aided by the colour scheme - floor tiles are brown, walls are a sort of beige, your kunoichi is white, and enemies are red. Where it could easily have looked like a jumbled mess to a kanji-illiterate player, Kunoichi succeeds in making its large, bold kanji characters pleasant to behold and easy to interpret. \n\nThe final cherry on this pleasing visual cake is a symbol key on the right of the screen, telling you what symbols are what (though only for the ones you can currently see - another nice touch that avoids clutter). It’s not the type of game to have a dozen enemies flocking around you at once, and your line of sight is limited, so this works very effectively to identify terrain features (doors, exits) and to distinguish between enemy types. The latter doesn’t become an issue until a few floors down, but it’s useful to be told at a glance that the shape charging towards you is an armoured ‘samurai’ rather than the standard ‘warrior’, without having to go through the usual unwieldy roguelike fuss of using an ‘examine’ command. \n\nThe Japanese themed aesthetics extend to the sound design too. There’s no music after the title screen but there is a steady background chirp of crickets or similar (familiar from quiet outdoor scenes in many an anime) and sound effects take the form of notes on traditional Japanese instruments. Throwing/retrieving your kunai (throwing blade) causes a gentle twang, being spotted by an enemy is accompanied by a warning note on a bamboo flute, and colliding with a wall is a single drum beat. \n\nThis brings us to important part - the gameplay. Being well presented is all but worthless if the game isn’t fun, and that’s why I initially found Kunoichi disappointing. I felt that there was little to the gameplay that it was all surface and no substance. With more play time, though, I realised that I was mistaking simplicity for lack. Kunoichi is faintly a stealth game. There’s no need to kill enemies if they’re not in your way, as there are no items or character levelling systems here. It’s easiest to kill them when they haven’t spotted you, as once they do see you they will chase you relentlessly from room to room, and there’s no combat here with which to defend yourself - once they catch you, you’re done. If an enemy comes alongside you while you’re standing still you’ll be able to knock him out on your next turn, but if you move and he moves alongside you at the same time, the game is over. The main way to dispose of enemies to avoid this situation is by throwing your kunai (shift + direction). You only have one, so you’ll have to retrieve it from the corpse afterwards, but it’s very effective. \n\nThe stealth element comes into play in a couple of ways beyond just evading enemies when combat is unnecessary. If you collide with a wall you’ll make a thump that attracts attention - like in ye olde Metal Gear Solid, one useful technique is to get into a good position, tap a wall so the guard notices you, then take him out as he steps into your line of fire. Amusingly, you can also ‘gouge’ - poke a hole in the wall to catch a glimpse of a neighbouring room. Traditional Japanese homes were partially made of paper! It’s a nice authentic touch and also an occasionally useful mechanic. In practice, though, the game isn’t really that stealth-centric - avoid head-to-head combat, yes, but don’t expect Tenchu degrees of sneaking. \n\nThere are a couple of very infrequent bugs I observed. Once, I bumped into a wall and then continued shuddering until my next move (rather than a momentary shudder). Sometimes the ‘stunned’, ‘seen’ and ‘heard’ status markers on your character linger indefinitely - I was stuck a with a ‘seen’ longer after I eliminated the enemies and left the floor. It even remained once I died and restarted the game. These are minor and infrequent bugs, though, and don’t affect gameplay - enemies weren’t supernaturally aware of me while I bore the infinite ‘seen’ marker. \n\nThe key thing about Kunoichi is that while it isn’t deep or complex, it doesn’t need to be. It’s simple but also fun, and very handy to play for short sessions. The fact that you can start, play, fail and restart in the space of a few minutes without a lot of fuss makes it easy to fall into that ‘one more try’ pattern. \n\nThe delightful presentation in both visuals and sound might be the main appeal of Kunoichi, but don’t make the mistake of selling the game short because of its minimalist gameplay style. It’s simple but fun, and definitely worth a visit. ",

(The enemy is *not* stupid though, and will try to stay out of your line of fire.) With such a small map, positioning is very important, though the dev starts you off with two rings that each give you three free actions each round to help escape danger or backstab tough enemies (50% chance of critical). In keeping with the name of the game, you get a new random item each round that you can keep or throw away. Definitely read the intro screen to understand what each stat means--it's pretty straightforward, but knowing the details in advance will make later choices easier.

I'd strongly suggest considering a way to show the remaining HP of each enemy--maybe a little number in the corner (maybe only for those that are hurt)--since it's a value that can be calculated/remembered for optimal play, but doing so somewhat reduces the fun. The fun of the game lies in superior tactical positioning, not remembering numbers. The game would also benefit from having some rings/wands to swap out, but the dev said there wasn't enough time. Not really too bad, since the sprint rings are quite useful regardless of your build--probably wouldn't want to swap them out, and certainly keep at least one! Wands on the other hand are completely missing so intelligence isn't important."

Well, maybe... the game isn't to clear as to why you seem to be engage in a life or death game of bombardment with bowling balls.\n\nIn the game you are given 5 moves per turn, which are executed simultaneously with the opponent's moves. You can either move one to one of the adjacent 8 squares or launch an attack. Attacks seem to be relative to your original position, or maybe just very inaccurate, so it seems to be best to target adjacent squares and limit yourself to 8-direction fire.\n\nAs of this review the game is barely in a playable state. It locks up regularly and requires a great amount of patience to progress. Simple scenarios like the player and an enemy attempting to enter the same square or an enemy attempting to move off the map crash the game. The game uses 2D sprites and a combination of keyboard and mouse controls, both are functional. The game is certainly unique, in my experience, as a plan-and-act 7RDL entry, and the scope of the project seems on par with other efforts. The game does have permadeath and some procedural generation, but overall it feels more like a roguelite game.",

As a full game it is complete, well polished, and perfectly sized for a 7drl. This is also reflected in the aesthetics which are clean and functional.

The crafting system could have made this great, but ultimately was a letdown.  Considering the lack of polish and features in other aspects of the game, it's really very hard to imagine what the author spent his seven days doing - this game has the scope of a weekend game at most, and I could easily see it being made in a day.",
    "ft": "Going around whacking things is fine, but in this case it seems you can only push enemies out of the light range.  The lamp dynamic is an interesting one, but it's a bit odd to have the edge of the light act as solid walls.  The crafting system seems like a nice idea but quickly becomes frustrating - there's no intuitive understanding of what sort of progression you can have.  Two rocks combined make a stone, but try to combine another rock and both items simply disappear.  This makes the trial and error process of crafting infuriating.  Even selecting \"use\" on an item will simply make it vanish in most cases.  Even once I'd figured out how to make crystals to extend the light range, the fact that enemies keep piling up and the reduced light range makes your hard-crafted creations vanish made the experience seem hopelessly undirected.  There are stats for reach, intel and sensors but it's not at all apparent how they might be improved or how they affect gameplay.  Ultimately everything just keeps vanishing.  I really wanted to like this game, but in the end I am unable to drag myself back for another round."

    "reviewText": "I’m going to try really hard not to be too harsh to Runic Ruins. I don’t know what the developer’s level of programming experience is, and Runic Ruins feels like someone making one of their first attempts at a game. If so, be proud. I didn’t run into any bugs or oddities, everything functioned as it was supposed to, and it never crashed. Also, there’s some form of art, something that I know isn’t necessarily easy to do. \n\nWith that disclaimer, I have to review Runic Ruins as a game. It’s incredibly basic. Use WASD to move from room to room in a five-by-five grid, looking for the rune that is displayed in the corner of the screen. When you find that rune and step on it, you’ll have to look for another one. At first I assumed this continued until you’ve found all of them but I no longer think that’s the case. You see, there’s a trick to the game. On my first sitting I played for as long as I could bear to (about 45 minutes) and never managed to find more than four of the 24 runes. The reason is the time limit. You’re given what initially seems quite a generous time limit to find all the runes, and each one you find rewards you with more time, but there’s no indication as to where the next one is, and with 25 rooms (including the rune-free starting room) I found it hard to remember which ones I’d seen where, so I always ended up just doing circuits or wandering at random, which soon uses up all your time. \n\nThe game mentions following the ‘glowing totem’ if you’re lost but I didn’t realise what that meant until I asked the developer. A glowing block in the starting room gives you a general direction for the rune you’re currently seeking, which means there are never more than four rooms that a given rune can be in (e.g. if the totem glows to the northwest, then your rune is in one of the four rooms in that corner). This basically eliminates the time issue as long as you’re nimble on the WASD keys. The rune locations re-randomise occasionally but this doesn’t have any practical effect if you’re relying on the glowing totem to guide you. So the game becomes ‘run through the indicated clump of rooms, run back to the middle, head out again’. After doing this for a little while I realised I was sometimes visiting the same runes more than once in rapid succession. The objective, it seems, isn’t to collect all the runes but just to keep going for as long as possible without running out of time. With no score count to indicate how many runes you’ve successfully touched, there’s no way to compete with your own record (unless you mentally keep count) and the experience is so dull and repetitive that there’s no reason you’d want to. The only ‘challenge’ comes in the form of blocks scattered around every room, which you have to walk around. Just busywork. That’s all there is to this game, and as a result I don’t think it can really be considered a game. \n\nIt’s not without good points. No bugs, responsive controls, decent enough art on the rune design (though the rest of the art is quite unpleasant to look at), no crashes or freezes. It runs well, it’s just not fun or even really a game. If, as I suspect, it’s an early effort in learning how to make games, particularly within such a tight time limit, I applaud the effort. This is more game than I can make. In the grander scheme of 7DRL entries though, and taken on its own merits as a game, I can’t possibly recommend playing it. ",

With the directional facing, stealth is a possibility, and even encouraged through skills and sneak attacks, since you don't stand to gain much from killing everything. The lack of a single value for HP is very interesting: You lose attributes with each hit, and while lost attributes regenerate slowly over time, you take so much damage from one hit that combat is incredibly risky since you'll die if any one attribute reaches 0, which is possible in as little as 2 hits.

There are three colors of orbs in the hexes: the big light-blue ones, the medium dark-blue ones, and the small red ones. Each type of orb is basically a time bomb - every move you make (well, most of the time, I'll get to that) advances the timer, so the big light-blue ones turn into medium dark-blue ones, etc. The red ones turn into skulls; stepping onto a skull (or a red orb, since it will be a skull when you arrive) kills you. You can, however, shoot fireballs to destroy skulls (but not red orbs), by double-clicking. Supposedly you can do this once for each row you've traversed, though in practice that should be far more fireballs than you need. You can also do a sideways (well, up-right or down-left) move without advancing the timer; this should also consume a fireball use.\n\nOnce you figure out what the heck you're doing, the game isn't actually all that hard; I was able to beat it in a few minutes.

Unfortunately this game really wasn't for me. In general the game is quite obtuse and hard to understand, with many completely opaque mechanics. Even after learning the lay of the game it is very repetitive, and involves almost no real decision-making. The main gameplay is moving a targeting cursor towards enemies so you can hold down a button to shoot them whilst they shoot you in real time - a very simple execution challenge with no tactical depth.\n\nI want to see an Atari Lynx roguelike :( Karri, please make something turn-based and grid-based with interesting tactical options!",

The first 14 floors of the game can also be exploited very easily, since there isn't a hunger clock and enemies can't go up and down stairs. Meaning you can fight by staircase and escape to regenerate health when you get low. This exploit becomes difficult to use later in the game however, because it suddenly gets much harder. But it gets far too hard, far too quickly so it only frustrated me. \n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the theme of the game, but not so much the gameplay.

    "reviewText": "Roguelike in the sense of procedural, turn-based and difficult but mixes things up with its suction mechanic. Use your futuristic vacuum device to suck in enemies and items as you explore. You can carry one item in a useable slot; anything inside the vacuum device is inaccessible. The aim is to get as much treasure as possible and escape. Sucked up objects and enemies stack in order, which makes it play almost like a procedural puzzle game. You can expel sucked up items/enemies in reverse order, most recent first. If you use all of your steam (fuel) you can expel an item with enough force to act as a weapon. I like this - attacking an enemy is difficult and requires thought, even a bit of preparation. Enemies are a serious threat. Unfortunately, too much so. You can’t attack an enemy when it’s next to you, and most enemies move at the same speed as you, so if one gets close when your device is already full, the game is basically over - no room to suck it in, no room to shoot. It’s also a bit of a pain that you can only carry one useable item, so if you find the key to the exit you have to take it to the door then go back for first aid or other item you might want (unless you have room in your vacuum and don’t have to release lots of enemies before you can get to it). All in all a really nice idea with lots of potential but the enemies need to not stay glued to you the instant they get close.

The game of hangman could be fun if there was hints or something. Also it needs a failure state as there is no consequence to choosing the wrong letter. The only loss state is the sub par combat. I don't really advise playing it, I advise looking at it. Watch someone play it. I have my video review of it and there was a link to another video on the games site because the graphics are nice enough to look at for a bit but the game play just did not satisfy me.\n\nInnovative\nYeah this game was innovative and gets a 3. I have never seen a game implement hangman in this way. I do think it could be implemeneted better and I went into it in my video. There is great promise in what I see but as is its just innovative and thats all I can say.\n\nScope (WARNING: Do not confuse with completeness)\nIt fits what I think can be done in a 7DRL so it can have a 2. It fits what I expect and its complete.\n\nRoguelike\nIt is a roguelike and deserves a 3. It seems different but its the same basic things with some twists to them. Just change the 3d blocks into a 2d tile and switch your character with an @ and be hard to tell it apart till you try to open a door.\n\nI spent a little under 30 minutes on this game and I kinda want some of that time back.

    "reviewText": "My time with The Curse of Midas was mainly spent in a state of confusion. Between some curious design choices and some (presumably) bugs, it took a lot of replaying to figure out what was going on. \n\nThis started with the title screen. The notes on the list of 7DRL entries mention that the title screen was never actually done, so what you get when you run the game in your chosen browser is a yellow square. I was expecting this the first time, having come straight from the list, but when I returned for review purposes a couple of days later I spent some time baffled as to why a game I’d played before was suddenly not running. It took a few minutes for me to remember that you just click on this non-title screen to start the game. It’s not an impressive start, and indicative of things to come. \n\nThere’s a surprisingly lengthy backstory to The Curse of Midas but it’s available only on the release list and the developer’s 7DRL blog, not in the game itself, and I can’t help feeling that more time went into writing the story than developing the game. That’s probably not true but it’s the gut feeling I was left with. Your aim, though you wouldn’t guess it unless you read the backstory, is to grab loads of gold from this dungeon and escape with your life. The story also mentions a rumour that King Midas eventually became a golem of pure gold, so you might surmise that you’ll run into that at some point. Again, the game itself says nothing of this, just dropping you straight into the dungeon without context. \n\nThe confusion that began at the blank yellow title screen only continues once you start playing. The game is entirely mouse controlled, which is fine, but nothing is clear. I’m all for figuring out how things work while you play, but I’ve completed the game now and I still don’t get it. The place is full of gold statues; when you touch one, it turns grey and something (or nothing) happens. The warrior statues seem to temporarily increase your attack stat, logically enough, but the effects of the wizard and the ordinary person have no discernible effect. There’s no magic system so the wizard doesn’t affect that, though there are wands so perhaps he makes those more effective. It’s very unclear though. The ordinary person statue doesn’t have any effect that I can see, apart from removing any attack bonus you might have. Again, I’ve completed the game and I still don’t get what the statues are about. \n\nConfusion continues. At random intervals the game starts playing itself. Your warrior/thief begins moving around of his own accord, attacking enemies and getting killed without any input from you. After this happened a few times I realised that if you hold the mouse button you sort of ‘auto-click’ so that when you let go of the button you can just drag the mouse around to move, interact and attack without having to click. I assume this is intentional but there’s no control explanation anywhere and I never intentionally held the button. Presumably I kept clicking for a fraction of a second too long. The fact that this function isn’t mentioned or described, it kicks in after such a narrow margin in click duration, and it often leads to accidental deaths, is completely infuriating. Even once I figured out what was happening and thus could actively try to avoid it, I still accidentally triggered it once or twice every game. \n\nSo I was gradually working things out at this point. Touch the warrior statues, ignore the others. Make the shortest possible clicks and if necessary cancel the auto-move with another click. Okay, under control. Then came the deaths. I rarely died from combat - except for the final boss the enemies don’t actually attack you, they wait for you to attack them. This is actually quite a nice feature and means that there’s almost a puzzle element in deciding whether to get into combat and with which enemies. It also means that you can often avoid unnecessary risk if you’re low on HP. So no, I didn’t died from combat very often, but I did die a lot from something else. What? I had no idea. I think I know now but it took some figuring out. I would be merrily playing, then suddenly the game would kick me back to the ‘new game’ screen. After this happened a couple of times I noticed that what looks like a message window flashes up for a fraction of second before you’re kicked, but there’s no time to even begin to read it. I always just closed the browser tab and walked away in frustration at this point, but after a few recurrences I stopped doing that and just went straight back into a new game, at which point I found that the message window from your sudden, unexplained death appears in the new game (if you don’t close the tab and come back later). You can’t read it when you die, only when you re-enter, which is presumably either a persistent bug or bad design, rather than a conscious choice. It turned out that I was becoming a gold golem, like Midas before me. So...I was being too greedy about gold? Makes sense considering the story of Midas but the game actually encourages you to get gold. If you read the backstory, it strongly implies that your whole purpose in the dungeon is to get as much gold as possible! If you don’t read the backstory you’ll have no indication that you shouldn’t grab all the gold you see. In fact, in either case, the game itself eggs you on in your treasure hunting by throwing up encouraging messages at certain gold thresholds - things like “you feel indestructible” and “nothing can stand in your way” (I’m paraphrasing, I don’t want to play it again to find the exact wording). So the backstory tells you you’re there to grab all the gold, and the game tells you good things are happening as a result of picking up gold, but in fact gold kills you (but you won’t know that because you can’t read the death message). \n\nAgain, it makes sense that you have to avoid Midas’ fate and working out that the gold is actually a danger is kind of satisfying in a way, but it would have been much more so had the game not botched the whole thing. Don’t tell me to collect as much gold as possible, praise me for doing so, then punish me for it a minute later. Bad design. \n\nThe other confusion is items. You have to work out what they do but sometimes this isn’t straightforward. The first few times I picked up a sword, I clicked on it to try and equip it but it just vanished. It took a while before I discovered that using a sword boosts your attack stat. I assume that’s temporary since using more than one sword doesn’t stack the bonus and sometimes your stat goes back down for reasons that aren’t clear, but it’s really not apparent how this works. \n\nThat’s how the whole game is. It has almost no explanation of anything, the explanation on the dev’s blog is actively misleading, the mechanics are opaque and confusing, there are bugs and conspicuous unfinished aspects - it’s a mess. There are glimmers potential for a good game here, but as it stands it’s neither gold nor even steel. It’s a lump of rusty iron that needs a lot of cleaning up and a lot of effort to turn it into what it aims to be. ",

    "reviewText": "The Deadly Four is structurally reminiscent of a Zelda-themed entry from a previous year - the awkwardly named I Rule, You Rule, We All Rule Old School Hyrule. A smallish single-screen level which is basically a static arena, monsters and player-like foes wandering around, and an ability selectable at the start. I don’t think there’s any connection, but the resemblance struck me right from the opening moments. Unfortunately, The Deadly Four is distinctly less ambitious than its Zelda-based counterpart. \n\nThe game is very simple, which isn’t inherently a bad thing. You’re just some person armed with nothing more than a stick, setting off to take down the four most dangerous warriors in the land. Fortunately the land is very small, the warriors are very stupid, and someone has left swords lying around everywhere. The deadly four themselves are represented by orange @ symbols, while various letters wandering around represent bandits, pandas and other aimlessly roaming things for you to kill. The premise is reasonably promising - a short series of tense encounters with tough opponents, forcing you to concentrate and use everything you can think of to gain a slight advantage. \n\nThat’s not how it works though. In practice, the deadly are deadly poor fighters. They hit hard, so you have to keep an eye on your health meter, but you can easily retreat and rest up to get your health back. Your enemies either don’t regain health with time, or do so much more slowly than you do, which means each battle is actually just a hit-and-run guerrilla offensive - pop up, smack your opponent a few times, duck back to safety, repeat. As long as you remember to pick up one of the weapons strewn around as a replacement for your starting stick, you should be ok. You probably won’t even need the healing sushi items which are likewise lying around all over the level. They’re less effective than just pulling back a couple of steps. Hell, I found that *resting in the middle of combat* provided more effective healing than eating sushi. \n\nThis might seem like a cheesy approach but it’s genuinely the only way to beat these opponents. With no armour, no character levels to increase your combat strength, and woefully useless healing items, there’s no way you could beat these opponents without cheesing them. When you do cheese them, they’re pretty easy. When I realised I could just back off and rest without my enemy doing the same, it only took a couple more attempts to beat the game. Kind of. \n\nThere isn’t really an end to the game. When you beat the four themselves, the game congratulates you but says the battle isn’t over. I assumed this was because I’d left some bandits alive, so I trekked round and cleaned them up. With nothing still living in the world except me...nothing. A simple “game over, quit?” or something would have worked, but no. It feels like the game can’t be bothered to notice whether you’ve won. It occurred to me that this might play out differently if you kill all the other enemies before finishing off the deadly four but I can’t muster the enthusiasm to go through it again. \n\nThe Deadly Four isn’t bad, for all my moaning. It’s mildly fun for a little while, at least until you beat it once. Having done that, there’s no reason to return. Once you know you have to cheese your opponents, you’ll probably be done with it in a few minutes, but it’s not bad while it lasts. It is, however, disappointing. Taking on four foes who are substantially stronger than you in one-to-one duels should be tense and exciting but it just isn’t. The skills you choose from at the beginning present an illusion of varied playstyles but the skills are all passive and make so little difference to the experience that they might as well not be there at all. \n\nThe Deadly Four is worth the 20 minutes or so it’ll take you to beat it, and you won’t kick yourself for doing so, but you will sigh and think “this could have been much more”.

Though I haven't read the book this is based on / inspired by so I could be way off base. Long story short is that you are trying to introduce a dragon to a stick with some pointy metal on the end.\n\nThe gameplay is nethack inspired, for better or worse, with the bulk of the screen being given over to a dialog window. The battle generic monsters by rubbing against them, find generic loot by walking on it, step on generic traps without being able to detect them and slay a generic dragon by poking once with a weapon.\n\nThe game is complete and seems to be relatively bug free. Currently, it has to be compiled from source and I ended up with a flickering screen, but I can't determine if that is my fault or the application's. The graphics are near monochromatic ASCII and the controls inherit the worst of nethack's \"press Q to quaff\" and \"press u to unwield\" which is about as unwieldly as it goes these days and the game requires none of the \"wear bag on head\" nonsense that stems from nethack's everything and the kitchen sink approach. The game is a decent diversion, I completed it on my third or fourth try, despite flicker, and I didn't feel the game was a chore to play. Aside from that, this is a cut-down, one level, nethack-like, its nothing anyone who has played a couple RLs won't be familiar with.",

There is a medium variety of enemies, many of them quite difficult, though made more so by the fact that it can take a while to learn how resilient you are. Using a numberless bar for your resource is an interesting design decision, since it makes the system a little bit more opaque on the surface; technically all costs are handled in percents so the numbers really shouldn't matter, but enemy HP and the damage they do is a number, so the two systems are a bit difficult for a player to reconcile. It can take a while to figure out whether it's worth attacking or avoiding a certain foe in a given situation. The concept is certainly interesting and still worth checking out. Most abilities you can learn (acquired at random altar-like locations in each map) are mostly of the \"do damage in different ways\" variety.",

First, there is no combat. That's a big hurdle to overcome in making it feel like a roguelike.  Also, the town is static between playthroughs.  There is randomness in the names of the heroes, and the loot they return with, but its really not enough to feel like a roguelike.  A smaller detail is that the lists of materials, what you can craft, and the stats of the items are all visible from the beginning of the game.  There really is no sense of exploration which, in the absence of combat, is something I was really looking for in order to capture the feel of a roguelike.

The different materials, coupled with different levels of items you can forge for each material really present you with lots of options.  In the end though, hero's deaths felt too random.  There wasn't enough different causation from the player's actions, so when a hero died it was usually just annoying.  This is probably exaggerated by the fact that world is so static.  I would play games exactly the same and have wildly different experiences.  The initial couple of hours were a blast, but there's nothing drawing me back in."

Those that survive may return wealthier and seek to buy better equipment, or bring you items they find which you can melt into ingots for forging more gear. It's interesting to walk around the town and chat with locals on the first playthrough, but the gameplay revolves around your little workshop and occasional trips to the metal merchant at the mountain pass. The merchant is where you'll be spending your gold on ingots of different metals to forge better weapons and armor. If you don't equip the adventurers well enough they'll all die and the orcs will eventually overrun the town.

    "c": 1,
    "reviewText": "I quite like The Tablet of Ananias, and that’s why it’s so infuriating to play. The first thing that jumps out at you when you start playing is the control scheme. At first I thought I couldn’t move - I tried both keyboard and mouse but with no success. It took a few minutes to realise that the game doesn’t use free movement as in most roguelikes but instead uses a sort of node-based movement system. Rather than being free to roam around each room as you see fit, you click on a door to slide on over to it, or on an item to go to its location (and again to pick it up). I gather that the idea is to streamline dungeon exploring for the tablet market. There’s no fiddly clicking or key-bashing to move around; it’s simple, efficient and well designed for touch control. I played it on a PC but this control method makes perfect sense for a mobile device, much better than the ghastly on-screen keyboard I’ve wrestled with in mobile ports of things like Dungeon Crawl. \n\nThough it was designed with touch screens in mind, this control method works well enough using a mouse too. It alters slightly when you see an enemy, giving you fractionally more control. You still can’t move freely, only towards an enemy/door/item, but it slows down to a more familiar turn-based arrangement. Whether you’re moving forward to engage a foe or trying to escape through a doorway, you move one step and the enemies move one (or more, in some cases) until you reach your destination, in contrast to the smooth glide from location to location that you witness in non-combat situations. This slowing down for combat is a good idea in principle but not a great help in practice. Since you still don’t have freedom of movement there’s very little in the way of tactical positioning options. It basically comes down to which enemy you take a swing at each turn. It still works well enough, particularly considering this game seems designed to be short and streamlined, but it can feel a little limiting after playing more conventional roguelikes. Want to move round so you can put a weaker enemy between you and a stronger one? Tough luck. You’ll just have to tank the damage or try to run away. \n\nThis isn’t a big problem though. The fact that gameplay comes down to clicking on doors, clicking on items and clicking on enemies does lead to it becoming repetitive after a couple of hours, but again it’s worth bearing in mind that as a tablet game it’s probably not meant to be played in long sessions. People often bandy about the term ‘coffee break roguelike’ and I think The Tablet of Ananias is one of the rare cases in which that’s actually an apt description. If you have 20-30 minutes to spare, it’s well suited to a few quick plays. \n\nOr it would be, but... Sadly The Tablet of Ananias has a glaring flaw. Again, I haven’t played it on a tablet but on PC at least, it’s broken. I’ve played it in different browsers on multiple computers and this issue occurs with the same frequency in all cases. Basically, the game crashes 8 times out of 10. This is no estimate; I actually counted. Out of my first 10 runs, number 5 and number 10 ended in character death but all of the other 8 ended in game crashes. I took screenshots if you’re interested. Every time, after anywhere between 1 minute and about 10 minutes, I would go to move into a new room or a new floor and find that either I was stuck in a wall, I was off the map, or I was nowhere to be found at all. This wasn’t just a graphical glitch, either. The game became completely unresponsive in each case, forcing me to refresh the page and start the game over from the beginning. If this happened occasionally, I wouldn’t mind. Even the best and most polished games can freeze up or crash from time to time. But this wasn’t occasional, it was 8 times out of 10 (I stopped counting after the first 10 but it seemed to continue at about the same rate). To have promising run after promising run, including what seemed like a potential winner, ended by a glitch and/or crash is infuriating and unfortunately it makes the game impossible to recommend in its current state. I tried it on as many different PCs and browsers as I could in case it was my rig that was the problem, but this crashing issue persisted uniformly. \n\nThe game is pretty good. It’s a novel redesign of some roguelike fundamentals that works well, though could stand to be refined a bit more. It’s just a shame that you can’t really play it. There’s no point. 10 minutes down the line you’ll be defeated, however well you were doing, not by an enemy or by hunger but by the game itself. ",

The archer can pick up the occasional single-shot bow, and the mage will find use for spells on his path. Even getting one hero to the end of a screen is sufficient to carry on because if enough gold has been amassed, the fallen heroes are automatically resurrected. Apart from moving forwards and back, the player can choose to jump all the heroes over one tile, which creates opportunities for some more tradeoffs (although jumping is a bit overpowered).

Some form of hostile mothership and its attendant fighters try to stop you. In practice, this means you get a direction (northwest or northeast, I’ve never seen any others) and you head that way to find the beacon. When you find it (and once you’ve figured out what it is, because the game gives no indication of what a beacon looks like) you turn round and go back to the base ship, at which point you go to the next level and start again. The process is the same every time. Obstructing you are alien craft, asteroids and clouds of some sort that impede your vision. The main obstruction, though, is the controls. Turning takes you in a weird loop (e.g. when you turn right you move forward and right) which is probably meant to represent the momentum of a moving vehicle but in practice it means that you can’t steer with any precision, which gets you killed unacceptably often any time there are lots of asteroids around (which is most of the time). You just can’t manoeuvre around all the flying rocks because of this strange steering design. Worse yet is when you’re being chased by an enemy. When chasing, they move in to fly in a straight line behind you, but you turn in a loop, so however much you turn and turn and turn, you can never come round to face them so you can shoot. The only way to break this situation is to accelerate away using E, but you can only do this a couple of times before you need to recharge, so it doesn’t benefit you much unless you accelerate into a cloud, where the enemy loses sight of you. Surviving enemy attacks is so dependent on this specific set of circumstances that the whole thing feels like purely a game of chance. The procedural aspect is also a pain; sometimes you will enter a level and find that one or more asteroids are immediately beside your starting position and heading your way. There’s no way to survive that. Even without these flaws, the game would be a tedious exercise in ‘go over there, come back’. The design problems are the only thing that keeps it interesting, but not in a fun way. Skip it unless a lot more work is done to vary the gameplay from level to level, make enemy interaction more manageable, and prevent starting point death by random asteroid. ",

The game is a bit rough in terms of features, bugs, help, etc. But there are some very cool concepts in here: 1. The terrain moves by itself, but in a turn-based nature. Think of a moving platform like in mario brothers. But instead it turn based. Watching the patterns of blocks and using it to time when you step out into danger is a lot of fun. 2. The ever-spiraling level. There are no stairs, the level is divided into a 3x3 grid and as you advance past each section, the sections ahead open up and the sections behind close off. You may think you are going in a circle but you aren't!",

But there are enemies that jump, enemies that leave sticky goo on the cells, enemies that throw grenades, and each takes its own strategy to deal with.  I do wish there were some sort of powerups available, either special abilities or some sort of equipment or rewards to keep you interested in playing longer.   The game could also be improved with a scoring system to let you know how well you did, or at least how many g's you whacked before you kicked the bucket each round; the only indication of progress is the counter in the top left, and there seems to be no difference at all between the levels of the dungeon.",

Traditional 1HPs allow you to use planning and strategy to survive, but the narrow corridors here mean there are many situations where you simply have no way out whatsoever.  Frustration in these sorts of games is good where it clearly stems from a failure you realise you could have avoided; when it stems from doing everything right and getting trapped anyway, it's mostly off-putting.  The arbitrary waiting time at the arbitrarily capitalised \"Congratulations, you Died!\" message is quite annoying; being able to press a key to skip this would have been nice.  All that said, the game stays interesting - the technique is easy to learn and difficult to master.  In hex and triangularly linked grids, the gameplay is often a lot like Hoplite (a low-HP hex grid roguelike), and at other times it ends up as square grid - this offers the best gameplay of both worlds."

Could do with having less levels (and maybe less items) to make it a more satisfying experience, or a better pace to the game (weaker enemies and less item slots at the start, for instance). The fact that the level exit is always at the bottom also makes exploration bland, especially since one wants to minimise exploration to reduce resource usage. Might be more interesting if there is one specific camp/recharge site to find in each level."

It has a nice little camping system which reminds me faintly of SNES RPGs and maybe even something like Azure Dreams. Something in the movement and presentation kept bringing to mind Zombies Ate My Neighbours. It's a style I find charming and I warmed to the game quickly. It's definitely more on the action end of the roguelike spectrum but employs a limited item use/inventory management system to make things more interesting. Each item (weapon, spell book, etc) has a different effect and a set number of uses which recharge when you camp - which can be done once per floor when you're not being hounded by foes. This means the game provides constant pressure to get the most out of your uses each day. It's not prefect but it does make for a pleasantly entertaining game which, crucially, doesn't outstay its welcome. ",

    "reviewText": "Ardennes is an ambitious attempt for a single week. It has a board game-like action and movement system based on card play, and wounds are determined in combat by slot machine wheels which act effectively as rolling dice. It is essentially a board game. The options each turn are fairly comprehensive, with each soldier in your squad able to select cards to perform a variety of actions, including movement, attacks and supporting benefits such as scouting out neighbouring hex spaces. Unfortunately the game doesn't really explain anything, and it takes an unacceptably substantial period of trial and error experimentation just to work out how to interact with the game. \n\nEven once you begin to get a handle on how to play, the game is brutally punishing. This is to be expected in our genre of choice, but here it's too much. Once an enemy appears (which has happened on the second turn in every one of my runs so far) you won't be able to move. Enemies block your movement and keep you trapped in place until they're destroyed, but with more enemies continuing to spawn on the same space every single turn, there's simply no way to progress. Even the weakest enemies I've seen in the game require multiple attacks to defeat, and that's if (a very big if) you roll hits rather than misses. In the time it takes to be one solitary scout, tanks and grenadiers will be constantly popping up. I've made repeated attempts to play the game and not once have I been able to move after the first turn, or defeat enemies faster than they spawn. \n\nIt doesn't help that enemies are only susceptible to certain types of attack - sometimes just one - and action cards are cycled out of use, at least for a while. It's not uncommon for me to find my whole squad pinned down by a tank, unable to attack it because they don't have enough firepower cards between them. I tried splitting the squad up, but a lot of the time there's only one space you're actually able to move to, so you're forced to clump the soldiers together. Even when you can split them up, that just leaves them individually vulnerable. The whole thing is enormously aggravating. \n\nI applaud the developer's ambition in trying to port what is basically a squad-level wargame in the space of a week but the short time frame just harmed the effort. This needed more time. As it stands, it's barely playable. ",

The adventure system works fine, there's an impressive navigable map with enemies and ports and jutting mountains and mysterious jungles, there's a system of loot and upgrades. \n\nI was unable to play this in the web browser much at all. The adventure pop-ups wouldn't allow me to close them because the buttons were off the screen, so I ended up playing using the PC downloadable version. Ships sometimes seemed to explode without reason, or at least without me shooting at them.

Especially because there is no challenge in the combat yet and the adventure side of things is very prominent, I very quickly ended up just wantonly sailing the sea seeking my next adventure pop-up instead of really engaging with the combat system or thinking about the map.

After dying once in my first game, I managed to get invulnerable easily in all my other attempts. Even tried to get myself deliberately killed by chasing other pirates and not firing at anybody for turn after turn but I wasn't able to get sunk. Maybe enemies are only provoked when a gun-fight begins, but since very quickly my cannons became super-powerful I destroyed everything in sight with a click of a button. \n\nSo the fun in this game consists pretty entirely in the various imaginative, funny and often quite sexually themed multi-choice pop-ups that come your way as you explore the waters. The results from your choices seem to be pretty fixed so once you've seen them all the fun tends to run out. However, certain encounters can give you new traits which then open up new options in other events, keeping the fun alive for a bit longer. It's an impressive feat to have built this kind of linkage within a gamejam. It would be great to see somewhere the traits you have at any given time and it would also be nice if the encounters were more procedural. With challenging combat and more variability in events more fun will no doubt emerge."

    "c": 1,
    "reviewText": "I know many of us have had enough of gratuitous zombies but the idea of survival under duress in a world stripped of the things we take for granted is a decent idea and merits exploration. It's certainly a good basis for a game as unforgiving as a roguelike. This isn't that game, though 'unforgiving' certainly applies. \n\nIt's basically a dash from one block of colour (building) to another, search each for supplies. Search a building involves just entering it, followed by a short wait. When you're done, move to the right towards the next screen. Simple. Unfortunately you're constantly in danger of dying from hunger and/or thirst, and this is where the problems arise. \n\nIt's not particularly unusual for a building, when searched to yield no supplies at all. Considering that every single turn advances you towards your hunger and thirst limits of 50, you never ever EVER pick up food and water fast enough. Even if you found food in every single building you would probably starve before long, because food doesn't reduce your hunger bar by very much (water lowers your thirst far more, and is thus much more effective). You will need to eat multiple times on every screen, but might find only a couple of food items, or even none. \n\nWorse yet, searching buildings is guaranteed to spawn zombies. They're unlikely to wear down your health but it can cost 5 or more turns to bash one of them down, which just further eats into your already badly depleted satiation. Avoiding buildings will prevent zombies spawns but you won't get further than maybe two screens before you starve. Nor can you dodge around spawned zombies, as the movement is only 4-directional and zombies move at the same speed as you. If there's a zombie to your right, you MUST kill it to proceed, and as soon as you start fighting the game is essentially over already, because the time taken to fight will doom you. \n\nJust to rub salt in the wound, movement doesn't auto repeat - that is, you can't hold the button to move, instead having to press once for every step. This becomes in irritation with repeated plays as the game makes you walk the full width of an entire empty screen at the start of every attempt. \n\nThe game could work if it was developed more and refined quite considerably. As it stands, it's an unpleasant experience which has the feel of being a work in progress. The description says it's a prototype for a fuller game, and it shows. Avoid. ",

Instead, it feels like a turn-based matching game that may be interesting for people interested in Greek letters.\n\nThe trials of the title consist of gathering Greek letters, called runes, that are 100% effective or ineffective in destroying moving statues based on the randomized relationship between runes each play session. In one game, ? may destroy µ, while in the next it may destroy ?. Incorrect usage leads to a mistake, and five mistakes mean restarting from trial one while retaining the automatically-updated log of the rune relationships.\n\nThe resulting gameplay is relatively shallow: Determine what glyph you need to destroy and then either 1. choose it and destroy all the statues with that glyph or 2. pick a glyph you haven't used to try and successfully continue from 1 or take the mistake. Ideally, players would experiment to identify glyphs while they have mistakes available, but I didn't find a need to in my play through.\n\nAside from a bug preventing me from advancing past the fourth trial, the game looks complete; however, I'd be interested in seeing a version that used Greek letters more in the playfield, perhaps for the statues. As it currently stands, Cipher could be fun for some light puzzling.",

No upgrades, items or shops - just shooting a bow with left mouse, swinging a sword with right mouse, and using a bomb with f. That's it. Not even any ammunition concerns. \n\nFor a while it was ok. I've certainly played less competent games in this mould which were made in more than 7 days. Control is smooth, visuals and music are fairly nice, enemies are simple but functional, no bugs in sight... But the problem is that it doesn't last for just \"a while\" - it lasts *forever*. Well, I assume it does. I played for as long as I could bear to, before quitting in a string of curses. \n\nYou see, the game is one floor repeated. The layout changes but everything else is interchangeable. The same three enemy types, the same boss every floor. No items beyond a health pickup, no variation in visual style or music, not even an increase in challenge. Floor 25 might as well be floor 1, as might every floor in between. \n\nI recall that when I felt it was starting to overstay its welcome I looked at the floor count - level 7. \"Well,\" I thought. \"It's probably a 10 level game then. I'll push on to the end.\" Floor 10 ended, I went down the stairs and there was floor 11. Same old, same old. I swore (quietly). \"Ok,\" I thought. \"Probably either 15 or 20 then. I hope it's 15 because I'm bored now, but I'll force it til 20 if I have to.\" Level 15 came and went. So did level 20. Bear in mind that it started to get boring at level 7, identical floor after identical floor, with no variation but layout, and no increase in challenge. And it's not a difficult game in the first place. \n\nWhen I descended from level 20 and found level 21, I swore again - this time loudly. \"Alright!\" I raged at my monitor. \"I'll go til 25, and if that's not the end, I ******* quit!\" \n\nLevel 25 came and went. I quit. \n\nThe game is mechanically fine. Simply but competently executed, and inoffensively pleasant enough for about 5 floors. It goes on far too long though - either forever, or at least longer than my patience can stand. The crushing negative is that it never varies, and the 25th floor (and presumably many more thereafter) is fundamentally the same as the first. \n\nStarted alright, but ended up horrible. Avoid it.

The effects of the different weapons are cool, but don't seem well-balanced - the best bet is usually simply to take the most straightforward, highest damage weapon and keep using it.  This all leads to the gameplay being fairly repetitive and about simply chipping away at the enemy health bars over time.

The 'mini-tutorial' text is an essential read in order to have the faintest clue as to what's going on, and even then it'll probably take some gameplay experience before you start to remember the difference in appearance between sand and road, and how each will affect you. \n\nThe game introduces a very novel concept - the idea that moving across different terrain raises and lowers a resource (ninjutsu) which then determines how many action points you will receive on your next turn, and thus how 'long' (in terms of actions performed) your turn will be. Because this ninjutsu resource doesn't immediately raise or lower your action points but instead determines how many you'll receive the next time your turn ends and you recharge, you have to consider not only what terrain you're on now, but where you've been recently and where you plan to go next. The game is an assassination mission in which your ninja must inhume a local feudal lord, and every single enemy, including the target, can be very dangerous if you don't manage your ninjutsu with care. Your advantage is your ability to take multiple actions on a turn, so baiting enemies and positioning yourself to gain as many AP as possible for your next turn is crucial. \n\nThere are some oddities. Once you've killed the target you have to escape from the castle and then survive for a set number of turns - from memory I think it's 90 turns. That's fine, but having high ninjutsu (which is usually desirable) means you take multiple actions per turn. Useful when you're battling your way out past the vengeful guards, using a grappling hook, throwing knives and smoke bombs to escape, but no useful once you reach the far fringes of the map, devoid of enemies, and just have to wait out the timer. This results in a curious situation where a deadly ninja assassin, after performing a mission and successfully fleeing to the tranquility of the countryside, then has to spend several minutes sprinting back and forth across a road (so that your ninjutsu remains low and your turns pass as quickly as possible). \n\nMoreover, the game doesn't even end. Once you've waited out the time, you get a little \"you won\" message at the bottom of the screen and the game continues. \n\nStill, the occasional blemish doesn't harm the game too much. Clearly there wasn't time to add much polish during the week, but the game is still enjoyable and worth checking out. Just don't be put off by the initially confusing mechanics. ",

I keep going for a high score rather than a plain victory. Death also encourages me to try again, which is a good thing for a RL. None of the monster or spell mechanics are new, in my opinion, but they are unusual and work very well together here. The theme certainly is new though, and is definitely appropriate for a 7DRL.

The early game had some basic strategy to it: kite enemies into big groups then use a scroll to kill all them, attack individual enemies while moving, avoid hallways (the opposite of most RLs, in which hallways are a good way to funnel enemies.) But, the leveling system quickly lead to monotonous gameplay. Once you become powerful enough to kill an enemy in one hit, you almost never need potions or scrolls and could probably play forever. (Unless I'm missing something, but I played for an hour)\n\nLike most 7DRLs, it could use more content to fill it out. More items, enemies, rooms, etc. My favourite thing about the game was speedrunning through while kiting tons of enemies. An interesting development would be to make most of the enemies brutally hard (like the orc things in Catacomb Kids) forcing the player to run through the dungeon at top speed, avoiding loads of enemies and grabbing what they can before they find the exit.

    "reviewText": "This one was a surprise and messed with my head a bit, for reasons I'll explain in a moment. Fundamentally the game is about trying to get to the next floor while dealing the changing shape and size of your character. Everything here is blocks - you play as a block, which can absorb enemies of the same or smaller size, attaching those enemies to itself like Tetris pieces. The larger you are, the more powerful you become, but the more your movement is impeded as you can no longer fit through some gaps. \n\nThis is where the game starts to mess with my head. At first I thought it was a nice idea but more of a puzzle game than a roguelike. As I played more, though, I began to realise that the problems it presents are all very roguelike in nature. Do you want to absorb an enemy so that you'll be able to absorb more dangerous ones as you go progress, or do you want to stay small and mobile? If you absorb enemies you can survive multiple hits as your extra size gets chipped away, but you have to make sure your core doesn't take a hit. So being bigger is better, but it also means you can't dodge as easily since narrower passages will be inaccessible, which leads to you having face down more and more enemies. \n\nAdditionally there are diamond-shaped blocks which you can use to knock off some your pieces, so the game becomes a constant tension between the benefits and drawbacks of different sizes, and every enemy encounter is about manouevring and positioning. \n\nFor my money, those aspects are absolutely roguelike. The presentation and novel concept might mislead you at first but Dumuzid uses very roguelike ideas - it just applies them in a novel and distinctive way. For that, it should be applauded. ",

The game is entirely mouse controlled, and you can move anything up to several spaces in one move (an enemies will usually move only one). A big move costs more of your finite reserves of energy than a small move, but a big move also increases your combat strength, while a small move actually reduces it. Both factors are vitally important because you need to possess an enemy to gain a new body before your energy runs out, but you can only do so once your energy level is very low. At the same time, you must be strong enough to survive combat.

Allegedly inspired by Touhou (presumably the esteemed series of bullet hell shooters rather than the film studio behind Godzilla) it asks the player to choose from such unorthodox characters as Gardener and Doll Controller, then throws them into a mansion to find something out. The aim isn't really clear (a common thread in this year's 7DRLs) but progressing from floor to another seems to be the order of the day. \n\nThe first striking thing is the deluge of asterisks. Every room is virtually filled with a wall-to-wall blizzard of the things. 'Blizzard' is a fairly accurate word, since an asterisk passing over a space will obscure anything underneath it, such as health pickups. What are these asterisks? That's never made clear (there's that thread again) but from careful observation of what happens when I deliberately walk into one, and the developer's name-check of Touhou, I assume they're projectiles. That's Touhou's trademark style, after all - great, swirling clouds of energy bullets. \n\nSo the aim, then, seems to be to exit each floor until you reach the objective, trying not to be blasted apart by the torrential rain of incoming shots. Although the effect is striking to look at in an ASCII sort of way, it's also confusing. It can be hard to see what else is in the room, and whether something is firing all these shots or they're just...there. Enemies pop of sometimes but they're best avoided if possible. \n\nEach character class has three abilities. The Doll Controller summons dolls with different behaviour patterns, but what the other characters' abilities do is anyone's guess. I usually survive longest as the Gardner but I couldn't tell you why. Sometimes I use an ability but I have no idea whether there's a range, an area of effect, or anything like that - or even what the ability is meant to be doing. The health bar is fairly clear but the two other bars, blue and pink, are a mystery. The blue one might be linked to ability use but it's hard to tell. Often the pink bar depletes either continuously or seemingly at random. \n\nThe game definitely needs better help text. \n\nThat said, it's actually not bad. It's reasonably enjoyable evading the artillery deluge in search of the stairs - but it would be better to know how to use my abilities, and which bar does what. With over 120 7DRLs this year, opacity of gameplay can be enough to make a game not worth playing.

    "reviewText": "Feeding Frenzy is really a puzzle game more than it's a roguelike. The thing that gets it into the 'roguelikeish' or 'roguelikelike' category for me is the combination of turn based thoughtfulness and procedurally generated levels. Otherwise it feels very puzzley. \n\nThe idea is to eat enough on each level to be whisked away to the next. Food is scattered around each, and more appears as you play, but at the same time enemies are trying to eat it too. If you find the right powerups you can eat weak and medium enemies, which count as food. You can never eat the strongest enemies. The game mainly comes down to careful manouevring and decisions about whether to try and grab safe food away from enemies, or risk chomping down on the enemies themselves to clear the playing field a bit. It's a good design, simple and accessible but still offering tense choices. \n\nThe game's main strength is its presentation, not in the sense of being pretty (though it's pleasant enough) but in the sense of conveying information. Different enemies are different shapes. Strengths of enemies are represented by both colour and size - weak ones are green and small, medium ones are orange and a bit larger, while strong ones are red and the largest. Powerups match enemy shapes so you can easily see which foes they allow you to tackle, and the shapes of all your collected powerups orbit you so you can see at a glance what your combat situation is at any given time. It's an elegant design which works very effectively and I applaud the developer for devising it. \n\nThe game overall is good. It's enjoyable enough for a while, and the great visual design really enhances the gameplay. My one notable criticism would be the awkward movement delay. It seems the enemy movement is staggered, so once you get to about 5 enemies or more, your own movement feels very cumbersome. You move, then every enemy moves in succession, one at a time, before you can move again. \n\nThat's a relatively minor niggle though. The game is still worth playing. ",

    "it": "I thought last year's DataQueen introduced some novel concepts but strayed a bit too far from roguelikeness. FireTail makes this integration work much more successfully. It brings in positioning-based abilities which revolve around how you move through the environment, in a way which is related to - but distinct from - DataQueen, and it reinstates some roguelikeness. Very fresh and very original. ",
    "c": 3,
    "reviewText": "I've come to associate Darren Grey's 7DRL entries with three things: hexes, the T-Engine, and trying out unorthodox ideas which we never see in other roguelikes. FireTail exemplifies this style and I'd say it's the apex of Darren's craft so far. It's certainly one of the standout entries from this year. \n\nMy first play of FireTail was disappointing. I didn't really get it. I didn't understand how to attack enemies (you can't at first) and even once I picked up an offensive ability I found the display puzzling. The ability's name at the bottom of the screen lights up when you can use it, but it's not clear HOW you use it. I was frustrated. I ended up just avoiding everything, dashing for the exit from each area. Whether by luck or nimbleness of movement I got surprisingly far like that, just bypassing each area's boss entirely. I didn't even realise there were bosses around, I just ran and wondered why I wasn't finding any extra abilities. \n\nWith repeated plays I began to get it. The game tells you, I just didn't wrap my head around it until I'd seen it a few times. FireTail's core mechanic is one of those things best learned by seeing it in action rather than by reading about it. You find one offensive ability near the start of the game, and as a side effect the ability sets one hex behind you on fire as you move. This is your 'fire tail'. You can move freely between the firey hexes - an idea returning from last year's DataQueen (though some later enemies interfere with this somewhat). When two hexes (including your current one) are on fire, you can use the first ability by bumping an enemy. Subsequent abilities, gained by defeating more powerful boss monsters in each area, require higher numbers of burning hexes in order to activate, and they seem to need them in a specific pattern. \n\nThis is FireTail's strongest point. Behind the impressive gloss and smooth control, the gameplay is a tense, thoughtful test of tactical movement. Enemies teleport away, barricade themselves with ice, or dislodge you from your hex. Movement and positioning are crucial to playing effectively, and the enemies will do everything they can to disrupt your plans. It can be very tough at times, and patience is needed to chip away at some of the powerful bosses surrounded by hordes of minions, but it's just the right sort of challenge. \n\nIt's not without its flaws though. Earlier I said that some abilities seem to need fire hexes in a certain pattern. I said \"seem\" because this is very unclear. The ability name lights up when it's useable, as I mentioned, but *how* it's useable is more opaque. So far just bumping an enemy has worked for activation, but the ability screen mentions that some are activated just by waiting. Which ones? I have no idea. What patterns are needed for activation and why? I don't know. The game doesn't say, at least not that I've seen. \n\nThis need for clearer information on the use of abilities is a frustrating flaw but not a fatal one. Perhaps it's even conscious design choice, though based on the 'activation method' column which is populated entirely by 'nil' I suspect it's an oversight. FireTail is very much worth playing despite this occasional frustration, and it's certainly one of the strongest entries this year. Just expect it to tire your brain after a while!",

This sounds easy, but enemies spawn very rapidly, often faster than you can kill them.\n\nThe theme is somewhat Narniaesque. You play a fire spirit in a world of eternal winter. It didn't sound like a great idea when I first heard about it, but the theme is implemented very well. Each level has its own boss and an accompanying boss/level description that is well written.\n\nThe game excels in its unique ability system. Are you ready to be DAZZLED? Well, buckle up. While moving, your previous steps generate fire tiles which decay over time. On any given turn, you will be surrounded by 0-6 of these fire tiles. You can acquire (by killing optional bosses) up to 7 abilities that each correspond to a certain number of surrounding fire tiles. The really interesting part is that the power and ease of use of each ability corresponds to *when* you decide to choose that ability. Wrapping your head around which abilities to choose and how to activate them takes some time.\n\nFireTail has tough tactical gameplay, great controls, a clean UI, and excellent sprites.

No other progression and no items or anything like that. However, creating all the abilities and balancing them must have been a good bit of work. The thing that pushes it to a 3 is that each level has its own unique boss and its own flavor text.",
    "ft": "My biggest complaint with FireTail is that the combat too often becomes very tedious. You start a level surrounded by monsters, then more spawn in constantly, then bosses spawn monsters three times as fast as you can kill them, and then some monsters split off into two or three children. It's crazy! The second level is one of the worst and that's where you'll spend most of your playtime if you suck at the game like I do. I once counted how many monsters I killed on the second level: 78!!! This isn't just an annoyance. In most of my games I'm unable to kill the Titan King (because he has 12 HP and his minions each have 6), leaving me with one less ability. To top it off, meticulously clearing parts of the level of ice seems to be an optimal play and that's a troubling design. The game might be better on a smaller playing field with a lower rate of spawning monsters.\n\nHaving said all that, the game is pretty fun. Getting surrounded can be tense. Choosing which abilities to acquire and when to acquire them is an interesting strategic decision and offers some replayability. Choosing when to deploy them is a never ending tactical problem. The game will appeal more to those with a lot of patience."

Two improvements would make this a very fun game: 1) make the level design a bit tighter, so you don't feel like you're wandering down long, dead end hallways all the time 2) implement lots of enemies at once, all of whom have the ability to kill a lone adventurer easily. Or the monsters should at least be able to kill an adventurer as long as they attack in pairs or groups. I imagine using a stalwart to block a hallway and stop a very dangerous enemy who can kill a weaker character in 1 or 2 attacks.

Goblin Gold does exactly that and, while it's very simple, it comes out better than some games which tried to be more ambitious. \n\nThe game doesn't make its core idea very clear, and if I hadn't by chance read a post by the developer I might have dismissed the game as just walking around a map. It is that, but there's a little bit more to it. In essence, the idea is that goblins will only attack in groups. Lone goblins will always run away from you. Your mission is to collect all the treasures chests scattered around the map, and the goblins are trying to stop you, but they will hang back and bunch up before swarming you. \n\nIt's very simple but it leads to more tactical play than you might expect. Timing becomes important, as does choosing your field of battle. I've found that luring goblin hordes toward narrow strips of land flanked by water seems to be my best bet. You can only sustain five hits, so allowing yourself to become surrounded can easily finish you off. \n\nAgain, there isn't much depth to the game, but what's there is done well. It shows what can be done with just one simple idea executed adeptly. ",

    "reviewText": "Gore Grounds sets out to be a beat 'em up fused with a roguelike, and offers a selection of different attacks which then change with the use of different weapons. Barehanded you'll have several attacks including 'jab' but pick up a lead pipe and you'll gain moves like 'wallop'. Damage to body parts will cost you the use of some abilities (lose a leg and you can no longer kick, for instance) but also as a gruesome novelty you can pick up severed body parts to use as weapons. It's all silliness but there's still something entertaining about beating a Lovecraftian monster until its arm falls off, then taking the arm and using it to beat down a tentacled horror, then using a severed tentacle to break down a door...\n\nUnfortunately this intriguing emphasis on exaggerated combat is let down by almost unplayably horrendous control. There's an odd pause of around two seconds (I counted) between one move and the next. It's not so bad if an enemy attacks you during that interval because at least something is happening, but if you're just walking across the room it's agonising. Step...one, two...step... It even seems to be intentionally designed that way, since your @ goes grey during the down time and then flicks back to white when you can take an action again. It's a bizarre choice which makes gameplay move at a snail's pace. \n\nThe combat control is also clunky. There's no bump to attack here, which is fine. Your various attacks are assigned to letter keys, which is also fine. Pressing those letters does nothing, though. After a few minutes of experimentation it turned out that, as far as I can tell, you have to hold the key for your chosen ability, press a direction while holding that key, and then let go of both simultaneously. A second or two later, your @ will attack. It's incredibly cumbersome, and all the more so because the game doesn't have any help text or instructions, either in the Read Me file or in-game. \n\nIt's a shame. The idea is pretty good, but some absolutely bizarre design choices make the game a chore to play, and I can't really recommend a chore to anyone. ",

In some ways it's the most traditional roguelike I've played in the 7DRL this year, in other ways it's a fun inversion of the genre, and in still others it's a frustrating exercise in irritating design. \n\nHeart of Morning has the appearance of a classic roguelike. The display is chunky, retro ASCII reminiscent of a DOS game and the interface uses arcane Nethack-isms like semicolon to examine enemies. It seems initially like a wannabe - a game clinging to outmoded design tropes from the roguelikes of yore. In practice, though, it's really an inversion of many of those tropes. \n\nRather than starting off weak and becoming powerful (or even the reverse, as in at least one previous 7DRL) you are always powerful, but the denizens of the dungeon endanger your top tier kit more than they endanger you. Rust monsters corrode your metal equipment. Magical de-buffs get rid of your +5 and +2 bonuses. The first floor or two feel like hacking unstoppably through feeble foes that can't threaten you, and consequently they feel like a tedious exercise in searching for the stairs. As you descend a few floors, though, you begin to realise that the cumulative effects of various enemy abilities is gradually debilitating you. You might miss this on your first play or two - I did. I didn't read the messages closely enough. Even once I did read them, I wasn't concerned. You carry multiples of most things - backups suits of armour, spare shields, more magic rings than you can wear. But the enemies to gradually wear them down. \n\nThis would be interesting and worth an unreserved recommendation, except that the game seems to lose the plot part way through. I've played for a couple of hours so far (more incoming) and every single run has ended the same way - somewhere a few floors down, I walk into a room that is crammed to bursting with dragons and assorted other nasties. Whether I try to tough it out or retreat, I soon find a similar horde approaching from the opposite direction, and with this bombardment of gear-damaging attacks I soon succumb. \n\nDifficulty is fine.  Even difficulty spikes can be tolerable. But this is a matter of slamming into a brick wall suddenly. I can't say for sure that I'll never find a way past this, but I can't think of a new approach to take. You work hard at being careful, avoiding gear damage fleeing from rust monsters and picking off magic users from a distance. But then, however careful you are, you hit that room and die. Always. \n\nIt's a weird design choice and one that tarnishes an otherwise unreserved recommendation. Heart of Morning is worth playing, particularly if you want a game that feels like a classic roguelike while subverting your expectations, but I can't recommend it wholeheartedly because of the inevitability of falling to that one impossible room. With no skills to advance or new gear to find, all you can do is preserve what you already have - and it isn't enough. ",

Floors are created by dealing an enemy card and a treasure card into a 4x4 grid. Slaying the enemy card allows the player to take the treasure card, with the goal of collecting four aces. Players can advance to the next floor after clearing half of the rooms.\n\nIt's difficult to play Hebrac's today with its user interface consisting of prompts with the occasional screen redraw, and it's hard to recommend to play as a roguelike.

HBD2 is to HBD1 as Skyrim is to Oblivion - larger-feeling, more streamlined, but less RPG-ish. The improvements are mostly for the better. The slightly fiddly party management has been replaced by just picking up party members as you explore, and losing them at the end of each area (unless you find enough loot to entice them to stay). A few features have been added, such as ruins and telescopes, which bestow minor but welcome benefits as you roam. There's also a hunger system driving you forward in true roguelike style, and that seems to be the main danger in this game. At times I miss the RPG trappings of the previous game - party management made it feel deeper than maybe it was - and I actually preferred the original visual style, but in many ways HBD2 is a progression while still sticking with the same essential core gameplay.

In fact, it's the best looking 7DRL I've seen this year.\n\nThe game has an interesting mechanic that encourages you to explore each level as thoroughly as possible: the amount of the map you explore in one level is your starting health in the next. You encounter monsters, which can be incredibly devastating and your health (a representation of your health, supplies, and energy) continuously decreasing as you move around. This simple exploration mechanic sets the tone for the whole game because you need health to explore and you need to explore to get health. If you do poorly on a single level, you've likely crippled yourself and will die shortly.\n\nI was sometimes frustrated by the randomness. Though the combat is described as \"deterministic\", the number of monsters you run into is often luck based. Since two monster encounters can take off half your health, this can be deadly. Additionally, the value of the crew abilities varies widely. Some are indispensable (the ninja, which lets you mostly avoid monsters), while some appear to do nothing at all.\n\nEven so, Here Be Dragons 2 is quite fun and worth checking out!",

    "c": 1,
    "reviewText": "High Upon The Mountain tries something quite bold - blending survival-based village management with roguelike interludes. In principle, it could work fairly well. Each day you assign tasks to villagers  and/or to yourself, such as chopping wood, hunting for food, building fences, etc. These tasks are simply selected from a menu and then you get a report on the result; you don't actually play them. Performing these tasks makes you cold and hungry, so you have to make sure you use wood and food to keep yourself going or you'll die. Logical enough. \n\nEach night, the village is attacked by monsters and this is where the roguelike aspect comes in. The monsters come from randomly chosen directions and you can either fight them yourself, bait towards any villagers who you've trained to be warriors, or a combination of both. Generally I find the village warriors are much more likely to survive than I am, even when I choose the fighter class at the beginning of the game. I'm meant to be the village hero but I'm the squishiest person there! \n\nIf you survive the night (and that's a big 'if') the day commences as before, with more survival tasks. The problem is that this time no villagers will help. Without fail, the second day commences with a message saying no villagers volunteer, which means you can achieve almost nothing during the day as your tasks bring back results of zero or very low yields. I've played this game for over two hours and I can't figure out any way to make even a single villager volunteer on the second day. The game effectively ends there, because even though you can soldier on through more nights of combat, you'll soon starve or freeze without the villagers' aid. After the first day, they're happy to let you die. \n\nThe combat is also pretty shaky. It works on roguelike principles - turn based, bump to attack, f to fire a ranged weapon if you have one. The bizarre thing about this is that while combat will sometimes function just fine, with damage given and received, many times you will just show zero after zero, regardless of your equipment or combat skills. All it takes is two or three hits from an enemy (or sometimes just a single hit) to inflict 'bleed' status, and then you'll bleed to death in a couple of turns. There seems to be no way to stop the bleeding, no bandages or medicine. You can collect healing herbs during the day but they have a negligible effect, and you're already having enough trouble scraping together food and firewood all by yourself, without devoting half a day to picking a single herb. \n\nRanged combat is scarcely better. Firstly, you have to equip your bow in the inventory with z, then equip and arrow in the inventory with Enter. Why different keys? No idea. The you have to reload after every shot, which is kind of realistic I suppose, but a real nuisance gameplay-wise. The arrows are pretty effective when they hit, but they often miss, and as far as I can tell you can't retrieve used arrows so once you've expended your tiny supply of half a dozen or so, that's it. You're done with archery. There's no shop for you to buy more arrows; there's no way to craft more from the wood or other supplies; there are chests in the villagers' houses but I've never found an arrow in one of them. A few shots and that's it, you're done with archery for the rest of the game. \n\nThere are a few possibilities here. It could be that the game is riddled with bugs. It could be that it's just badly designed. It could also be that there are ways around all of the problems I've listed here. If there are, however, then the game obscures them so much that I couldn't figure them out. I've been playing video games of various sorts regularly for almost 30 years, and I slogged away at this game for over two hours. If I couldn't find a way to make any of the parts of this game work in that time, then something is wrong one way or another. \n\nThe idea is interesting but the gameplay is excruciatingly frustrating.

By the second day, none of the actions appear to have any effect: 0 villagers assist you and strangely your solo actions result in 0 output as well. You quickly starve/freeze to death and you have to continue to kill zombies that can deal a fatal blow (because of bleeding) in one hit. I will share one tip on how the game might be beatable, but I didn't have the patience to continue trying: [*SPOILER ALERT*] the zombie waits every 6 turns, so you should be able to get free swings in and kill it that way.\n \nCurrently, the one other review of HUTM describes the exact same experience.

Limited inventory use allows you to choose your current weapon, but that's about it. The enemies are all the same and I only ever saw one type of weapon for each class - one bow ('old bow') and one sword 'average sword'). The game can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, but how long it lasts depends almost entirely on the random placement of potions and enemies. It's fairly common to start off surrounded by too many enemies to defeat or escape, and it's equally possible to stumble across either far too few potions or far too many. If too many then you can, of course, remember their location and come back for them when you need them, but that leads me into the next problem. \n\nThe game world is a sprawling network of identical corridors. It's very, very easy to get lost and wander round in circles without realising you're doing it. This is exacerbated by the way the isometric perspective handles walls, which is hard to describe but results in many doors and items being invisible until you're right on top of them. There's no map, not even a partial one, so after a while the game becomes a tedious exercise in trying to remember whether you've been down this white and grey corridor before, or whether that was another one. \n\nThe unsavoury icing on the disappointing cake is the visual style - the very thing which is the game's selling point. It's true that the visuals are novel and charming, but the screen-filling block of almost monochrone ASCII symbols in a great grey sheet, combined with the way the sprites flicker whenever you attack, rapidly gives rise to a thumping headache and sore eyes. The game is worth a brief play to witness its unusual visual design, but the simplistic play and confusing layout aren't worth the eye strain you'll eventually suffer. ",

When you first glance at the game, the two @s staring each other down indicates this is a simple roguelike. In fact, it's quite complicated and resembles something closer to a turn based strategy game or a board game. You mine resources, build your power, summon monsters, and try to claim territory.\n\nThe game has a lot of flaws, but let me first say that the developer is obviously talented. The presentation is great. The systems are unique and detailed. Ultimately, however, none of the mechanics combine into a cohesive or balanced game. Many of the ideas here, while interesting, are pointless. Claiming territory seems cool. I figured that might be the win condition (like Go). Or maybe you'd get free movement inside your territory or be safe from enemy attacks? None of the above. I found it easier to skip that mechanic altogether.\n\nAnyway, I'd like to see what the developer could do in the future with a tighter, more cohesive idea.

Because you have to pool->convert->use, that's 6 clicks and a bunch of waiting to actually *do* something. When the map starts to get filled with enemies that can chain-damage each other, you'll be repeatedly forced to click a message box that alerts you to how much damage each enemy takes. Sometimes you'll be clicking this a dozen times per turn. There's a reason why most roguelikes use a message log.

    "c": 1,
    "reviewText": "This is an awkward one. I like the idea. The game is really two games meshed together - one a real version, and one a turn based version. The objective is basically to collect as many gems as possible and move to the next level. Enemies are trying to prevent this and they can be fought using a whip attack which swings in a circle around the player character. The novel thing, the thing I appreciate, is that the game provides the option to use the M key to switch between 'action mode' (in which the whole level is visible but everything happens in real time) and roguelike mode (in which vision is reduced to a small radius around the player character but time becomes turn based, allowing chance to think). \n\nEither would be fine by itself - a basic real time gem-collecting arcade game or a limited-vision turn based game. The problem lies in allowing freedom to switch between the two. Using the whip attack costs resources (stalk-like items scattered around the levels) but it's so easy to clean up by alternating between the modes. See where the enemies are in action mode, move towards them, allow them to bunch up as much as possible, then switch to roguelike mode for precision movement and take them all down with a few whip swings. Back to action mode again, and just hoover up all the gems and extra whips on the level. Repeat. \n\nThe ease of this abuse would be an issue by itself but it's exacerbated by the erratic control. In action mode, it's often possible to press a key 3-4 times before you actually move, while at other moments a single press will send you sprinting 2-3 spaces away. This makes even just collecting gems in an empty level a chore. Worse yet, it's easy to trick an enemy into colliding with a wall, which (in roguelike mode) causes all enemies outside your immediate vision range to die instantly. This makes the game basically a non-game. \n\nI said the game is easy but, in fairness, I haven't got to the end. I don't think there is one - I played for some time, maybe 40 minutes, on my last run without any discernible increase in challenge or progression towards a conclusion. I suspect the game is a score challenge and, in its current broken state, it's fundamentally not fun to play. I appreciate the novel idea but I can't recommend actually playing it. ",

At first I thought it was impossible to get very far, then I realised I'd missed something, then I realised the thing I missed didn't help much. Sometimes I like the game and sometimes I don't, usually in proportion to how much I've been playing it that day. \n\nIt's a pretty simple dungeon crawl. Four-way movement, enemies with varying amounts of health and damage power but no special abilities that I've observed, and some treasure. You start off by the entrance to the dungeon, you go inside, and you don't last long. Repeat. Repeat, repeat, repeat. After a while (about half an hour in my case) you start to wonder why there's a purple bottle with a number beside it in the UI. Maybe you've found some of these potions but they don't seem to do anything. Eventually you think \"This is impossible. I must be missing something.\" The next time you start the game (or die, since the game immediately restarts you without even a key press or mouse click needed) you decide to poke at the edges of the starting area, just in case. Can't leave that way, can't leave that way...but wait, you can go north! And east! \n\nYes, there's a vitally important shop off to the east side of the starting area with no indication that any such thing exists. The only reason you'd even try to go that way is just on the off chance there might be another screen. And if you try west or south first, you might give up before trying the other directions, since they reinforce the original impression that there's nowhere to go. \n\nTo the north there's a meat (healing) shop which is locked. East of that is a potion (magic) shop which is also locked. To open either of them you need to buy a key which is available in the shop to the east of the starting area. This place is essential if you want to get anywhere. It has spells, keys and more powerful versions of your basic sword and shield. You start the game with 55 coins, which is enough to buy a mid-tier sword or shield and a spell. I recommend tooling up before you even enter the dungeon. \n\nWhen I discovered this I cursed the poor design but felt relieved that I knew how to work toward progress. It's the classic RPG grind - adventure for cash, buy better gear which lets you get further, get more cash... Here, though, it rapidly becomes a little cumbersome. For a start, there's no way I've found to get back to the surface quickly, so every time you want to buy something new you have to trudge up through multiple floors, and then all the way back down again. This does serve to force a judgement call about whether to press on and risk being killed or make the boring slog to the surface yet again, but it still reeks of awkward design. \n\nThere's also the question of acquiring the treasure needed to buy new gear. You don't get money for killing monsters, only for opening chests. This does put you in a very roguelikeish position where avoiding combat is usually a better option than fighting, but since treasure chest spawns are extremely inconsistent you can't really refine a viable approach. Sometimes you'll find 200 coins in the first couple of floors; other times you'll descend several floors and not even reach 100 coins. This inconsistency means it's down to luck of the draw as to whether you can buy the gear needed to survive in the depths - not a good position to be in. \n\nI could have resigned myself to having futile attempt after futile attempt and just making the best of the runs with plenty of treasure, effectively start-scumming - \"Is there much treasure on floor 1? No? Exit and restart!\" To mitigate this I did devise a workaround which involves casting the fire spell and then patiently kiting every enemy into the flames (the fire remains in place until you leave the floor) but this gets old quickly. \n\nThe long and the short of it is that Little Warrior is a charming enough pocket-sized dungeon crawl but has some questionable design decisions which cause playing it to become an irritation altogether too quickly. I have some fun with it if I haven't played it for a day or two, but after several attempts in one day I start to get frustrated. Worth a try but too flawed to get a strong recommendation. ",

Additionally, you can use your limited stamina to augment these stats and you can use items in various ways. Calling them \"dice\" is a bit of a misnomer because they typically aren't rolled. Instead they function more like flat bonuses. The draft is such a cool mechanic because you have to consider not only what you need but what your opponent needs You'll often take a die to keep it out of your opponent's hands. I was very impressed that the AI was always smart enough to take the dice that I *didn't* want them to take.

You've got resource management to deal with and the wounds you can take are serious liabilities. At first I was annoyed by how most turns ended in a parry for both parties, but that's really the point.

    "c": 2,
    "reviewText": "A few years ago I went through a phase of playing a Steam game called Terraria, and that's what MineClimeR(L) reminds me of most. It's not as vast and fully featured as Terraria of course, but it's kind of a roguelike version of a similar concept. You're delving as far underground as possible in an attempt to learn the truth behind various rumours and bring evidence back to the surface. To descend you'll need a pick, some rope and a lot of care - the caves are full of sheer drops, dead ends and hostile creatures. \n\nYou start off with a pick and some rope. The rope is absolutely essential since the biggest danger is falling. Your vision radius into unexplored areas is painfully small, and you can easily step off what seems to be a low ledge only to discover it's a gigantic plunge. It's wise to anchor ropes before moving into the unknown so that you can descend in safety or cross large gaps - but you only have a limited supply of these anchors (you retrieve the rope itself automatically). Soon you'll have to craft more from the materials you mine from the walls. Even your pick has a limited lifespan, though, so don't overdo it!\n\nIn many games, crafting feels forced - a fashionable inclusion superfluous to the main gameplay. Here it fits neatly. It makes perfect thematic sense to make do with whatever you can scavenge while you're exploring, and it gives you a reason to risk the durability of your precious pick to mine useful trinkets from the walls. Crafting is simple, too. Hit Tab to open the menu, and if you're able to craft anything from your current supplies, its name will be listed. The main thing you'll be looking for in this list is Anchor, so you can continue using the life-saving qualities of your rope. \n\nI compared this game to Terraria and that's definitely the most conspicuous comparison, but the structure of the objectives is very roguelike. Descend to the bottom of the caverns, find something specific, and then climb out again (I've never got to the bottom but the help text mentions returning to the surface). Somehow the game still manages to feel like a roguelike, even though it seems to be doing something very different. \n\nThe game isn't without its flaws. One glaring oversight (or unwise intentional choice?) is the entrance to the caves. This is always a sheer drop which will injure you or kill you if you just leap down - but that's the only option because your rope/anchors don't activate while you're above ground. That's logical in that you don't have a cave wall backdrop but it means your game always begins with at least injury, and often outright death. I suppose you good dig down through the ground instead but a dig of that size at the start of the game would take an aggravating toll on your pick. I don't see why you can't just enter the caves in a less stupidly lethal fashion. It's like if Rogue started you off by immediately setting you on fire and leaving it to the RNG to decide if the fire goes out before it kills you. Stupid. \n\nThe game also occasionally crashes to desktop when using the crafting menu. It's not so frequent as to be a huge annoyance but if you feel you're making good progress and you're suddenly booted with no save, it can be aggravating. \n\nAll in all, MineClimbeR(L) is an admirable attempt to combine two types of game and it works surprisingly well. It's flawed but worth playing nonetheless, an with a bit more polish it could have staying power. ",

Therefore I'm taking risks, I'm learning the terrain and, when I have to, I'm doing long descents by making cubbyholes in the wall and rappelling out of them.

The sprites and observing faces have a crude, Microsoft Paint look to them, but the whole garish style lends itself to a surreal and dreamlike ambiance which I suspect was intentional. I can appreciate that. \n\nUnfortunately that's the game's most enjoyable feature. At heart it's a straightforward puzzle game which, structurally, reminds me of the original Game Boy. Get to the exit while avoiding enemies or leading them into obstacles. You can't attack but traps harm enemies just as effectively as they harm you, so manouevrability is your best defence. It's a debilitating weakness to the game, then, that manouevrability is so limited. Movement is 4-directional, which can be fine, but when the gameplay hinges on nimbly dodging around dangers, 4-way is very awkward. This is only exacerbated by the fact that enemies move at the same speed of you, which means that an enemy higher up the screen (the exit is at the top) can often block you. This is how a run usually ends - a blocking situation which the player had no means of avoiding or preventing. Frustrating. \n\nFor that reason I can't recommend Never To Tell. I like the surreal stylistic choice but the gameplay and control need more work. ",

The combat is more typical of the active-time-battle system than the turn-based battles of RLs, but there is plenty of procedurally generation in this game that treating this like a JRPG is unfair. I found the combat to be somewhat shallow, but that is a general complaint I have with these kinds of games anyway; the inability to avoid combat means you just maximize damage output as best as you can, and supplement that with healing when necessary. However, there were times at which I thought about who should act first, to take advantage of damage stacking or multiple attacks, so the combat is not totally obvious. The controls are simple to use and the UI is clean and understandable. Remember that you can move items around in the inventory, which can help compare equipment. Definitely give this game a try, and also try to get the best shotgun for your medic if you can; that thing was the main reason I got through some of the later fights.",

    "reviewText": "When I first played Phage, my reaction was twofold - I was pleased by the retro (but graphical) visual style, yet simultaneously disappointed with what seemed to be a simplified version of an earlier 7DRL called Possession, which was itself hardly complex. Kill enemies and possess their corpses to then kill stronger enemies and possess *their* corpses. Why? No idea. \n\nWell, that mistake was mine. \n\nFirstly, the game does tell you (though discreetly) why you're going on this spree. You have to destroy all terran life. That's not a lot to go on, but it does give you an objective. Reading the developer's remarks, it seems you're a bioweapon which has been unleashed and is now fulfilling its programmed purpose. None of this is communicated in the game itself though - the game just tells you you're weak and you need to destroy terran life. \n\nYou can't kill much in your initial serpentine state - a couple of hits and you're finished. Kill a weak creature, upgrade, kill more, and basically work your way up the chain. Bodies take damage over time while you're in possession of them so it's in your best interests to find a new target as quickly as possible. A bit of exploration will lead you to a human colony and that's where you work really begins. \n\nThe game mechanics are very simple, and the controls are just movement  (hex movement performed using QWEASD or the numpad). Although it's not complex and the idea has been attempted with some success before, Phage does put its own spin on it by having the aim be to eliminate the human colonists. You can't take out more than one enemy, maybe two if you're at a serious power advantage, before your current body is destroyed, so the game forces you to use the alien lifeforms in the jungle as a combat resource. It's an intriguing interpretation of the concept. \n\nPhage isn't deep but it is fun. Worth checking out. ",

As a shooter, the concept sounds OK on paper: one basic weapon, a more powerful weapon that recharges, and a \"speed boost\" that gets you away from enemies. But it just doesn't work: whenever you go to shoot, your character stops completely. At that point, you are surrounded by enemies. Your only hope is to constantly speed boost around the map and fire a few potshots at enemies while you run with your tail in between your legs. Once you complete the single floor, this is nothing else to do.\n\nIt appears that the developer also happens to have released a very good looking game on Steam, so I'm going to chalk this up to not enough time/effort put into the challenge.",

    "reviewText": "RobberyRL is in essence a platform game. There's running and jumping, and although it's all done in a turn based way, that element feels a little gratuitous. There's ostensibly stealth too, though I never found that using the 'sneak' mode made much difference. Nor, for that matter, did using the 'run' mode seem to have a noticeable effect on my speed. \n\nThe game isn't bad once you start to understand what you're doing. Forget about stealth and just parkour your way around the levels, grabbing treasure. Once you feel a bit more comfortable with the movement you can perform great leaps and hang from edges like a pro. A loot percentage counter tells you how much treasure you've collected, and once you have over 50% of the loot, you can exit the way you came in. At that point you progress to the next level without fanfare or interlude, which is a bit confusing the first time. The landscape looks the same, so I nearly closed the game assuming it hard started over when I won. In fact there are several levels, the transition from level to level just isn't well signposted. \n\nThe idea is solid enough, and fairly intriguing, but there are flaws in the way it's executed. Guards largely move at the same speed as you, and they spot you from a mile away even when you're sneaking, so you'll spend a lot of time in close proximity to them. If you find good armour early on, that means the game is a cakewalk as the guards effectively can't hit you anymore. Without good armour they'll pound you into the dirt pretty quickly as they cling to you like armed limpets. Since the guards are almost impossible to avoid even with maximum stealth, this can make the game very frustrating or very easy, depending on the item drops. \n\nSpeaking of item drops, they're the only thing that varies from one attempt to the next. The level layouts and even the guard patrol routes (as far as I observed) are identical each time you play. This means that although identical play won't get you through every time, because you don't know where the loot is, you can at least devise an optimal exploration route after a few attempts. \n\nAs I mentioned, neither sneaking nor running seems to behave any differently from normal movement (in the end I just ran everywhere, because whatever negligible speed boost it might impart was more valuable than the useless stealth system), and the same is true of the skills to which you allocate points at the outset. I experimented with all-sneak, all-melee and all-lockpicking builds, and none of them were any more successfully at any of those tasks than any other. No character ever killed an enemy, regardless of combat skill. Sneaking was never useful, regardless of the level of sneak skill. Unlocking doors randomly takes anywhere between a couple of attempts and dozens, with no apparent reference to your lockpicking skill. \n\nThe game is a fun diversion once you get the hang of it, and it's worth taking a look at for something a bit unusual, but it has too many flaws to get a strong recommendation and there's really nothing roguelike about it.

    "reviewText": "Another one that doesn't work. That seems to be one of the themes for this year. I enjoy the Wild West theme (cowboy roguelikes are an untapped resource!) and the aim mechanic around which the game is based, while not earth shattering, is a nice addition which could be built into other games. The longer you aim at the target, the more likely you are to hit as your aim bar fills up each turn. Unfortunately your aim bar seems to fill just as quickly even when you're moving, so there really isn't much of a downside, which means that waiting for the bar to fill becomes busywork rather than a tactical decision. \n\nThere's also an oversight in the UI. Key functions are listed (a to aim, f to fire) but one is missing - enter to confirm the target so that you can start firing. This led to several minutes of snarling and gnashing of teeth as I tried to work out how to actually shoot anything - which, after all, is the point of the game. \n\nThe biggest problem, though, is that the game doesn't work. Every single time I've played it (which is now well into double figures) the game has frozen up after a couple of minutes. No error messages or anything, it just stops responding to commands. This means that I've never been able to see if there's anything else to the game beyond the very basic shooting gallery of the first minute or two. \n\nOn this basis, my advice is to avoid it. Nice idea but it's pinned on a game which seems very very shallow and, if not, hides its depth behind a reliable early-game crash. A shame; I like the Wild West setting. ",

In both games, the turn based movement system lets you weave in and out of asteroids. Even more satisfying is that this game lets you lead enemies right into their death by taking them near asteroids.\n\nThe coolest part of the game is the way you move on the hex grid. You choose between \"easy\" and \"hard\" moves and you can't do two hard moves in a row. This leads to a bit of challenge in plotting our your actions and it successfully maintains the feeling of momentum that would see in a fast paced arcade game. Your mileage may vary, but I personally had a very difficult time actually winning dog fights. There seems to be a lot of luck in how enemies are arranged and what they decide to do. Even so, I suggest you check out Rogue Sector.\n\nIt appears that the developer quaffed the wrong potion during development, so kudos for getting this done anyway.",

    "reviewText": "Rogue Space Marine is easily one of the strongest entries from this year's 7DRL. The idea is simple - roam a space station activating computer terminals and defeating enemies in order to move to the next level. To this end, you're equipped with 3 abilities which operate on a cooldown timer. I know many roguelike players don't enjoy cooldown timers in things like ToME4 but it works well here, because you don't have a huge suite of abilities which you just rotate through (as you do in ToME) but instead only 3 - shoot, melee, teleport. It's possible that more abilities can be gained but, if so, I haven't got that far in a couple of hours of play! \n\nThis small range of abilities means that you have to carefully manage your use of them. If you shoot an enemy then for the next several turns you will have only a melee attack. If you shoot an enemy and melee another then you will have NO attacks until one of them recharges. This ties into the game's most inventive feature - having the ability system double as the health system. When you take a hit, one random ability will be removed. A second hit, a second ability. When all your abilities are gone and take another hit, it's game over. \n\nManaging your ability use is one of the main features of the game. The other is taking cover. There isn't a formal 'cover system' but you will hide behind workbenches and engineering consoles frequently, as enemies blast at you with weapons far superior to yours. \n\nThe most impressive thing about Rogue Space Marine is its balance. It's challenging but surmountable. Each time I play, I learn a bit more about good ways to approach certain enemies or situations - which is exactly what roguelikes do best. It's not a 'pure' roguelike and dispenses with a lot of the conventions of the genre, but it certainly contains strong roguelike features. \n\nI can't even criticise the control. Usually I find it irritating when a roguelike's keyboard control scheme still requires some mouse use, but here you can either do everything with the mouse or use QWEADZXC to move, 1-2-3 to select abilities and mouse to aim. No awkward moving your right hand back and forth between numpad and mouse! \n\nRogue Space Marine is a very strong game and a great achievement for a 7DRL. Definitely check it out. ",

    "c": 3,
    "reviewText": "Rollgue is a dice-based dungeon crawl but not in the Hero Quest style of old - this one literally uses (representations of) dice as both the player's character and any monsters encountered within the dungeon. It doesn't try with the theme, either. There aren't orc dice and kobold dice, just your die and then all the others. It's a novelty game through and through but in this case that isn't a criticism. A novelty game can be just fine as long as it's done well. \n\nAs far as production goes, Rollgue is very impressive. Visuals and sound are both very good, control is smooth and responsive, and I've yet to run into any bugs. It can be a little frustrating at first because it's not entirely clear how to actually control your die - what makes it leap upward or skid across the floor - but once you get it the game becomes more fun (tip: starting your move-drag on the bottom edge of the die keeps you low, and starting it on the top edge throws you upward). \n\nThere isn't a lot of depth here. Rooms are either empty (or almost empty, with maybe a health restoring crystal present) or they contain an enemy/enemies. Like accurate movement, combat took some figuring out because the game doesn't really say anything about it. As far as I can tell, the current attacker has to collide their die with the enemy die, and whatever number they roll is the attack value (from which any armour or debuffs are deducted). If you roll a high number but don't bump the enemy die, it seems you inflict no damage. It's amusing nod to the 'bump to attack' convention of roguelikes. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, Rollgue is too fickle and superficial to have staying power. Roguelikes do involve a lot of luck, but the art of becoming good at a roguelike is learning how to stack the odds and make the most of your lucky breaks. There's none of that here. You roll a die and hope for the best. The entire appeal of the game is in its novelty rather than its depth of gameplay. \n\nIn this case, novelty is enough. Not a long-lasting time investment, it's true, but worth a play to see something different. Rollgue stops just shy of being gimmicky and incorporates enough little nods to the genre to suggest that the developer knew what they were doing. ",

    "reviewText": "A surprise gem! Initially I was unimpressed with Runner Puncher - you run, you punch, whatever. But there's a lot of tactical variety and roguelike ferocity just beneath the surface. \n\nThe control scheme is odd at first. \"Why can't I just walk around normally?\" I wondered, frustratedly. Well there's a good reason. Runner Puncher is all about movement. You don't stand still or confine yourself to a small area when doing battle. There's no luring enemies into bottlenecks in order to wear them down one at a time. No, Runner Puncher is full of movement, and everything affects that. \n\nThe control is simple but seems odd at first. Using either the mouse or the keyboard (I favour the latter) you drag a line of movement out from yourself to a destination point. When you either click or hit Enter, you move towards that point. If nothing interrupts you, you'll get all the way or most of the way to that point. It feels cumbersome at first but once you begin to get the point of the game, it makes sense. \n\nThere are no other controls to speak of. Items you walk over equipped automatically, whether they're good or bad. Many of the effects of the items come down to more than a boost to defence or damage - instead they add to your movement, or slow you down but prevent knockback, or various other effects which impact the way you move around the levels. \n\nEven enemies are geared towards this aspect. Some teleport or pepper you with arrows, forcing you to move in a direction other than the one you wanted, but the most galling foes are the ones which have 'on death' effects. These include knockback, pools of acid, and poison touch. Much as an enemy might trouble you while it's alive, it might be more dangerous to actually kill it! \n\nThese traits seem to be assigned more or less randomly to base enemy types which their own powers - e.g. wizards can teleport, but Embiggening Wizards teleport around while alive and then enlarge nearby monsters on death. An Acid Wizard, on the other hand, will teleport while alive and then leave a pool of acid on death. This means that the exact enemies featured in the game very from one run to the next and always keep you on your toes. Simply moving your cursor over an enemy will list its health and powers, so make sure you check them out. It's vital to know what you're up against if you want to make informed decisions. \n\nAnd therein lies the roguelikeness. More than the ASCII visuals, the turn based movement or even the fierce difficulty, Runner Puncher is a roguelike to its core because every decision has weight and meaning, and the more you know about your situation, the better decisions you will make. \n\nI expected to dislike Runner Puncher. I was mistaken. One of the standout entries this year, and well worth your time to play. ",

This game is a bit of both. Your aim is to amass 90 credits within three days. You do this by undertaking missions in the form of a series of self-contained, puzzle-like screens. You control 3 ships initially, with 4 action points between them. Using these actions optimally in order to grab credits and helpful bonus effects without being destroyed forms the crux of the gameplay. My first instinct was to fight enemies if they seemed to be a threat, but after a little while it became apparent that this isn't the best course. When you destroy the last enemy in that particular puzzle-screen, you warp to the next. Any credits or multipliers you didn't collect are lost. The upshot of this is that it's often best to avoid combat as much as possible in order to grab the cash. An interesting idea, and it's nice to see a squad tactics game which isn't all about eliminating the opposing force, but personally I found it altogether too easy to get boxed in and run out of AP. The enemies outnumber you a lot of the time, plus they're as strong as you and as fast as you. Some might relish this but I found it frustrating. As I mentioned, I'm not the audience for this.

The square you have to move is chosen at random, and any items on it will be thrown into the platform it collides with.

    "reviewText": "I wanted to like Second Stepper because the idea of controlling two characters with the same key presses intrigued me. And that part is fine - you can push one of the characters against bits of scenery to adjust their position relative to the other character. It works well enough in that respect - but there are some serious flaws. \n\nFirstly, the game falls into the trap of believing the procedurally generated level layouts make a game a roguelike. That's not to say there's zero roguelike influence but it's a very tenuous connection. There's pushing the boundaries of the genre, and then there's pushing at them from a great distance outside using a long stick. That's not inherently a deficiency in a game, but this is a roguelike challenge. Roguelikes should at least be the starting point - the core. \n\nSecondly, friendly fire is on. That means one of your characters can shoot the other. At first this seemed like a logical extra challenge - not only survive each level but avoid shooting your ally. The problem lies in how easily this happens. All it takes is for both characters to nudge against the same wall or obstacle, and suddenly they're in a line and one is shooting the other in the back. This isn't a game ender - you can revive the fallen character as long as the other is still standing - but it's frustrating. The frustration is exacerbated by the fact that you revive a character by walking over them. Do you see the problem? You walk over the character and they jump to their feet - and begin following your button presses again. Now both characters are clumped together and shooting each other, and every time your revive one, you gun them down again, only the revive them and shoot then... You can separate clumped characters by pushing one against another object but it's still frustratingly easy to keep shooting each other by accident. Friendly fire seems like a mechanic which needed to be re-thought a bit in this case, especially in conjunction with the way revival works. \n\nSecond Stepper is fundamentally an arcade game. The fact that time proceeds only when you take action lends the faintest hint of roguelike but it's still basically a retro arcade game which would have felt at home on an Atari of yore. We seem to be seeing a lot of these this year. ",

The mechanics are all there, but when you first see an enemy you get to name it. Gradually (or all at once if you use the 'examine' command) you get to create the enemy - its attacks, its behaviour, rate of loot drops - everything. The whole game is like this, even down to how many floors the dungeon has. All of these settings are saved so that over multiple plays you gradually create a game which was crafted by Jeff Lait but then customised into whatever you prefer it to be.

It worked well there, and it works well here too. \n\nAnother MGS comparison comes up in the way you deal with guards. It's often best to just get past them, but if you're able to get close enough without being seen you can actually knock them out. The game would be fine, if a little basic, with just this essential gameplay in place but a welcome touch of extra depth and playability is added by powerups. There's one on each level, awarding a randomly selected power which can be activated with a key press and recharges over time. These include the likes of speed bursts, reduced guard vision range, and freezing time. \n\nAll in all, the game is a good effort.

It doesn't matter how good I get at aiming if it decides to shoot in a 10 degree arc anyways.  Why ammo is on the same menu as weapons is unclear, likewise, health packs I have to switch to a random inventory entry, use, and switch back whilst in middle of combat.  There has to be some visual indicator of being hit other than just slowly lowering the health bar.  Likewise, death is way too abrupt, you need a moment of denouement to realize what happened before the restart menu.  Where can I see my point total?",

Walk around in a 4-directional way through a series of small mazes, trying to avoid being touched by dollar signs. \n\nThe main problem with the game is its opacity. What are the blue exclamation marks scattered around? No idea. If you walk over one then nothing happens. If an enemy walks over one then they turn blue but otherwise work in exactly the same way as normal. If an enemy comes up alongside you, you can bump to kill it. Sometimes this works but other times they kill you. What determines the outcome? No idea. At first I thought it was the blue exclamation marks, but no. Some blocks (trees?) in the mazes can be destroyed with a bump, to create a new opening. Which ones? No idea. I've experimented and there doesn't seem to be any consistency or pattern in the breakable blocks. What are you even trying to do? Again, no idea. Just keep going until you can't anymore. \n\nThat's the problem. Nothing is clear or explained. It's unclear what things do, or why they work in the way that they do. It's also not clear whether there's any difference in direction. From the starting area you can head off in any of the four cardinal directions but you can't return to a previous screen, and no branching off to the sides, so once you pick a direction you're committed to it. Is only one direction valid, or do all of them lead to the nebulous goal? Unclear. \n\nThat says everything about Stay Strong, really. Everything about it is unclear. With no inventory, interesting enemies, impressive presentation, or really any feature to make it anything other than forgettable, there's no reason to play it. Even if you do, you'll forget. I keep seeing its title and being unable to remember whether I've played it, even though I've done so a multitude of times now. \n\nI'm sure an effort was made here. but skip it. ",

Otherwise, my only hope was to wait for my oscillator to be positive (letting me deal damage)…which almost always coincided with the glitch's oscillator being positive as well (letting them deal more).

Everything is tied together: The knobs and switches on the synthesizer can be manipulated by picking up certain items on tiles and they set the size and shape of the waveform, while FX tiles also move around the board adding tactical depth. The sequencer shows when different elements are due to act and it is important to tactically skip beats to make the most of your turns. Does that sound fun? Because it is fun! \n\nFor me this is THE highlight of the few dozen 7drl entries I've seen so far this year.

Volume is HP, pattern is the level, etc etc. The UI is clear and the gameplay lucid (once you've understood what everything means, which does require consulting the video/documentation, but that's FINE). The sound fx are horrific as must befit a glitching retro synthesizer. In truth, I expected there to be much more in the way of sounds and music in a synthesizer game but I understand that is asking for quite a lot. Minor gripes: Since the player character is the @-symbol, I would have preferred enemies to be traditional symbols as well as some of the enemies are not very clear. It is excellent to be able to hover over elements on the game area to find out more about them.  \n",

    "ct": "\nSo many mechanics for a 7DRL living in relative harmony that it delights the soul. No redundant bits on the synthesizer screen. There is a variety of enemies with different behaviour and none of them feel overpowered, the waveforms feel fairly balanced. This is a mad machine of many parts and I didn't encounter any crashes as I poked and prodded it. I did notice some bugs and imbalances, however:\n\nBecause the actual gameplay area is rather small (8x8), player placement at the start of levels seemed to be too punitive. Often I would be born right next to an enemy or two and be forced to take damage before I could do anything, which might have killed me (had I not managed to make myself practically immortal). More than once I was hemmed in at an edge of the map by a few enemies right from the get-go and wasn't able to make use of any of the tactical niceties of the arenas. I'm assuming that the 8x8 grid is paying homage to some feature of actual synthesizers, but nonetheless I would recommend expanding the game area a little, or else improving the initial placement algorithm. A bigger arena might make area-effect bonuses more useful as now I didn't really find them worthwhile. \n\nWhat ultimately brought the challenge-level to near zero, however, was a two-part exploit I came across fairly often: First, it is possible to lure enemies onto tiles that reduce their damage potential to zero. Even on its own this is fairly powerful, but doing this on levels with a healing tile elevates it to the next plane. On such levels I was able to spend as much time as I had patience for waiting for the wave-form score to be negative whilst being on the same tile as the healing Gain special tile. Since there is no hunger clock, effectively this meant I could keep on increasing my HP forever. Thankfully, level progression does seem to address this a little as the waveforms reset now and then so enemies don't forever remain impotent. Hopefully this is easy to remedy - perhaps the FX tiles could disappear from a level after a given amount of activations?\n\nOn top of these reasonably fixable things there was one more element which made the game feel less than complete for me: the low- and high-pass filter mechanics which take a third of the screen and tie in logically so well with the functioning of a synthesizer and the wave form behaviour unfortunately had such a limited impact on gameplay that I was able to ignore them completely, or to be more gracious: all I needed to do was to avoid picking up the filters on the gameplay area. Since this mechanic is woven so tightly with the other ones it's not immediately clear to me how you would improve it without breaking the link with actual synthesizer operation. \n\nI thought about this for a while since the game is such an impressive achievement overall but given the combination of these balance issues I can't bring myself to give full points. It does feel that it won't take much more development to get the game up there (barring the filter issue). Let it be clear though: the game is definitely complete enough to play and have fun with!\n",

    "it": "I've seen other 7DRLs based around laying explosives but this one seems to use it in a way that pushes the adventure angle. You're exploring a labyrinth and trying to escape, but you can only break major walls with very specific bombs, of which there are a finite number. Throw in a bit of crafting for good measure. Novel. ",

    "reviewText": "When I first played That's Okay, You've Got Explosives I hated it. I grumbled aloud and posted a snippy gripe on Twitter. It felt awkward and cumbersome to me. \n\nI was wrong. \n\nWhen I returned to the game to give it some more time for reviewing purposes, it began to grow on me. The interface is a bit clunky, admittedly. WASD moves but you can move diagonally by pressing two directions at once (why no numpad?) and the biggest culprit is being able to drop bombs with E but having to use the mouse to pick things up. Yuck. Still, once you begin to get used to that, the game starts to show a surprising amount of potential. \n\nIt's based around explosives, as the title suggests. You're trying to escape from a labyrinth which has no doors, just a load of continuous walls. You have a seemingly infinite supply of basic explosives (the count shows 99 but I've never seen it deplete) which you can use to demolish ordinary brick, but the major walls are distinctive grey stone affairs which can only be destroyed using special golden explosives. These golden explosives are finite in number, and a lot of your time will be spent firstly trying to find the next one, and secondly locating a suitable section of wall to break through. \n\nThe labyrinth also contains its share of monsters, and you have no means of fighting them other than your explosives, which are on a timed detonation, so if you want to survive you'll develop a technique for kiting enemies over a trail of bombs. It feels clumsy at first, but as you adapt to it you find there's a certain elegance to the dance. \n\nFinally there's some crafting available too. Monsters sometimes drop items like feathers or magic orbs, which you can combine with some of your explosives to form new types, such as sticky bombs or teleporting bombs. I've found these to limited usefulness, and for the most part I stick to the basic bombs, but it's nice to have the option. \n\nAll in all That's Okay, You've Got Explosives turned out to be a pleasant surprise which just needs a bit of patience to start revealing its qualities. It's certainly not flawless and aside from the limited crafting options it's not particularly deep, but once you get over the initial awkwardness of the controls and its bomb-based structure, finding your way out of the labyrinth while dancing a deadly explosive dance with the monsters is surprisingly compelling, and keep pulling me back in for one more try.

That's the only function of the feather, and you have infinite regular bombs, so there's no real choice not to craft the throwing bomb. It ends up being a time wasting routine the player has to go through every time a crafting item is picked up. Instead it would be better just to give the player the new bomb type.

    "reviewText": "Every now and then someone attempts something like this - play a roguelike from other side, as the one controlling the monsters. This one does it better than most. \n\nThere isn't really much strategy to it, or even much in the way of tactics. You use your action points to spawn a group of monsters or a single stronger monster. Alternatively you can spend a few points to take control of a monster personally, which drops you briefly into roguelike gameplay as you try to take down the hero. Unfortunately the hero is much stronger than anything you can throw at him, and your control won't last long. It's not really a very productive use of your action points most of the time. \n\nIn general, the game feels as though you're rapidly burning through your action points and not even making a dent on a hero who is just getting stronger and stronger. All you can do is try to time your monster spawns so that they catch him when he's already fighting some pre-existing monsters and ideally when you can get him surrounded. This can be a bit hit-and-miss though - the group spawns don't seem to be consistent in number, with a group sometimes numbering as few as two monsters but still costing full price. The powerful monster option is scarcely better. It's more consistent - one monster alone, always - but the strong monster is really just a standard monster with better kit. Think goblin with a healing spell rather than berserk minotaur lord. \n\nAlso, the AI is a bit wonky. Sometimes you'll spawn a group as close as you can to the hero, who is already pinned down by other monsters, but the new guys just mill around aimlessly. This is exacerbated by the spawn locations. You can't spawn monsters in view of the hero, but what constitutes 'in view' seems to be variable, and sometimes your new group will be simply too far away to notice that he's there. It can feel like you're making no progress and I was about to give it up as unwinnable. \n\nThat was when I won. The hero ran into a large-ish group of monsters a few floors down, I threw in a quick group and a strong goblin, and he went down. I didn't feel like I'd played particularly well or cleverly to make that happen, but it was still satisfying. \n\nOnce you've beaten the hero, you probably won't play again. You don't feel you have enough control over the outcome for it to be worth experimenting with different approaches. Still, it's a fun diversion while it lasts, and the most accessible and polished form of this idea I've seen from a 7DRL. ",

The areas bleed into each other, so that it feels as though you are moving from a plains into a swamp and then into a forest (for example). The enemies are straightforward to kill, other than the Golems and Dragon, and there are some interesting, if sadly underwhelming, items. My favorite is the potion of lake which creates a lake where you throw it. Other than using it for easier passage over the lava area though, it seems useless. Even here, the lava area is the only one with terrain that matters and the second area with actual obstacles. Hence, a potion of lake effectively removes the only terrain challenge in the game. This is my biggest complaint; although the areas are visually distinct and come with their own unique monsters, there is otherwise no difference between them. Hence, it feels the same if you’re walking through a forest one-shotting wolfs or walking through a swamp one-shotting snakes. Greater mechanical variety in the enemies and levels, to provide some tactical challenge before the end, would greatly improve this game.",

Instead it tries for humour, which just leave a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nEven if you were to peel away the unpleasant theme and ignore the fact that the gameplay is as roguelike as my left slipper, there's still the problem of it being badly designed. You have four choices of direction in each room. Some of them don't work - it'll say that direction is blocked - but there's no way to tell which ones are inaccessible until you try to move that way. Rooms are also inconsistent. Move east to the next room, then move west back to the first room and it will be a different room with different exits. Many rooms contain combat encounters but these consist of clicking either 'fight' or 'flee' and seeing what happens. Even the visual presentation doesn't make any sense half the time - many rooms use an identical image, and you start off in an area consisting entirely of white shapes on a black background which look like a default screensaver. \n\nThis is a dreadful effort - incredibly lazy game design wrapped thoughtlessly in a sensitive topic which should be approached with care and respect but here is half-heartedly bandied around with scorn, and to top it all off there isn't the faintest sign of a roguelike here.

It revolves around a novel idea relating to stealth - you have two available disguises, and each will fool one type of enemy. If you wear your vampire disguise then vampires will leave you alone, and the same for wolves with the wolf disguise. This means you're constantly switching back and forth using the spacebar so you can get past enemies to the exit. It's an intriguing idea. \n\nThere are some drawbacks which prevent a recommendation. The gameplay is very, very simple. Generally you can just walk around large parts of the level in either disguise and alerted enemies will be too far away to reach you. There are also some oddities of layout and enemy placement which cause occasional annoyance. Every time I've died in the game it's been because of a looped corridor with an enemy of either type at each end, meaning there's no way out. You could head towards one end wearing the appropriate disguise but you can't move through enemies even when disguised, so even the friendly ones block you in. The only time enemies move is when you're in the wrong disguise so sometimes you have to bait them away from their position, but it becomes problematic when there's nowhere to go. This all basically comes down to needing more polish and refinement. \n\nThere are a few items scattered around which immediately have effects like teleporting you or temporarily allowing you to attack foes, but they're more a mild novelty than anything particularly important. \n\nGood effort on trying something different but the game needs more work to become worth recommending.

Likewise, if you didn't carefully watch the blinking health before attacking you don't realize that the chest actually damaged you.

There is no items or shooting, so at first sight, gameplay is boring - monsters have a lot of hp and go directly to player, so you must lure them to passages then hold arrow key till they are dead. On some levels monsters are slightly more villenous, but general tactic remains the same. The fun part is developing a character. You get some bonuses with XP, they increase your stats. Another important source of power are rewards from level bosses - after killing of them you can choose one of 3 bonuses, but exact nature of them is not shown. Instead there is a flavour text that give only small hint about reward). Some choices are clearly better than other and some are totally overpowered. The funniest was a second level - i have found ONLY one combination that allowed me to win it: take +3***, then -3***+9*** from levelup, and *** from a first boss(i decided to omit spoilers). I've tried about dozen of combinations, but only this one always wins and other always failed for me. Later on some bonuses become overpowered while some other (presumaby) crashes the game, so while there is still a fun of exploring what rewards does, exhaustive search of combinations wasn't needed.

Learning to play this is like starting that whole process over again from square one.\n\nThe interface is tiny and icon-based. The level fits in an 11x11 grid of characters. Two more columns on the left hold the inventory. Each row has an item symbol and a number 1-9 showing which button to press to use that item. (The \"weapon\" and \"armor\" items take up the other two rows; they aren't consumable per se.) Two columns on the right contain meters for when the next monster spawn is, and how much experience you've gained.\n\nYour health ranges from 0 (dead) to 9; the digit is your character. Enemies are represented by letters; they generally have two hit points so they are represented by capital letters and then lowercase letters. (There is one enemy type with three hit points.)\n\nYou will need to read the external manual thoroughly to make sense of the game, and will have to refer back to it continually until you've familiarized yourself with the rules. A few examples: If you have armor, monsters whose color matches your armor cannot hit you. Certain terrain squares will change your color. There is an inventory item that fills empty inventory slots with copies of your other inventory items. There's a monster whose attack gives you an inventory item that, when used, subtracts a hit point. Another monster's attack destroys your first inventory item, which if it's your weapon means you can't attack monsters until you find another. Etc.\n",

For instance, when a monster's attack destroys an item or gives you an item animation would help highlight the transaction. As it is I generally don't notice that I've lost my weapon.",

Player have two forms - in a human form you can cast spells that damage multiple monsters, but you are out of mana very fast. In a beast form you have three melee abilities and slowly regenerate hp and mana with each hit. It may take several tries to fully understand strengths and weaknesses of both forms and to feel when switching between them is optimal. There are also additional items in a chess and death effects from monsters that adds tactical depth. Overall rules are clear and predictable after getting used to - i really likes that feel when at first you look at game and don't understand what is going on, then start to understand that there are rules, and after some time everything become evident.

The goal of each level is simply to get the ball onto an exit tile and avoid letting it go out of bounds or into a pit. It's easy to lose control of the ball, but luckily you tend to move faster than the enemies. There are abilities like kicking and dribbling and they are indeed very useful. Unfortunately, several abilities were left unimplemented and the rest can be quite hard to understand. Perhaps it's because I'm not a huge football fan myself. There are a slew of football inside jokes in the game, which went right over my head. This game needs a bit of work, but the idea has a lot of potential, seriously.

There's no ending to the game and it is possible to continue indefinitely, but the content of the game doesn't last long enough to remaining interesting for that extended period of time. Collecting characters and items is really exciting, but soon you realize all it amounts to is HP & Damage that almost feels more like a single character. I would have loved to see even just a little more there in terms of gameplay variety and I think even a little bit done in that way could have greatly extended how long the game is fun for.\n\nDespite that Andromeda Divided is worth playing until you master its mechanics and it's quite enjoyable for that time.

The levels are quite impressive and employ both generated key cards and unevenly distributed difficulty which makes progress through them feel... well like progress. Likewise the item generation is quite ambitious, but unfortunately it doesn't really have a varied impact on gameplay other than upping the damage your attacks do. The same even applies to the idea of having a squad of characters; it's an ambitious idea, but ultimately it doesn't really have a huge impact on gameplay in a way that makes the game feel really varied.",

Once you get used to how the levels are generated and how you can approach fights efficiently enough to not run out of consumables there's nothing left to see or do. I think the biggest failing on the fun factor is that having 3 characters feels superfluous which ends up a bit of a tease really. Since only one character attacks at a time the other two feel mostly like meatshields and the only squad tactic is to juggle who gets killing blows so you can get free healing from leveling up.\n\nIf the characters in your squad at all felt different or unique I think the game's fun would have lasted a long longer than it did."

The mountain map is always the same, so far as I can tell, while the occasional dungeons are randomized a bit (I think). The quest sequence is the same, too.\n\nThe fact that the main map is always the same, and the quests are the same, means the game becomes increasingly repetitive to play as you gradually piece together how things work. The combat system, inspired by the old game Wizard's Crown, is interesting but fairly lethal, and I never found any additional healing bandages beyond what I started with. Combined with the fact that enemy pathing is very poor (it's easy to leave them stuck behind a boulder), and that you earn nothing from killing enemies beyond the occasional new weapon, it's clear that combat needs to be avoided.

I haven't done the tutorial myself so I'm not sure if/where this deviates from its source, but I've reviewed one or two other games that clearly came from the same origin. I played down to level 14; I don't know if the game has an ending or not. It feels like a subset of the original Rogue. I ran into rocks, daggers, swords, shields, health potions, scrolls of lightning, confusion, and fireball; rats, orcs, and trolls; and the same stats and dungeon generator as the other libtcod projects I reviewed. Combat damage is not randomized at all, so the game feels like a war of attrition. At least when I played, resources were plentiful in comparison with the monsters, which I appreciated.\n\nI'm guessing the developer is new to programming and/or Roguelikes. If so: Congratulations on completing a project! It's not easy. There's also no shame in copying stuff. Don't let low marks get you down; I know my entry this year will get low marks for things too. Now that you have a working base you can experiment, and do another 7DRL next year.\n",

If you are patient, the monsters offer almost no challenge. You do have some unexpected deaths at first, due to getting wiped out by combos. Later, due to the level layouts, the game gets harder and the last level is actually rather brilliant. I would discuss it more, but I really don't want to spoil the fun.

The mechanics come through well and it does a good job of presenting a puzzle that really makes you slow down and think a bit.

There's also never that much in the way of outright danger; mostly you feel a sense of dread that you've ruined your chances at clearing the level."

I've found the main feature of the game ()and eventually won) - melee is not your main weapon, your main weapon are roots. They hit enemies that are close to you enough, and there is additional skill to hit them even more when they goes out of roots. This makes all battles combination of kiting and pillardancing. Yes, you should kite even ranged atacking monsters (and most of dangerous monsters of game are ranged attacking and have greater radius then your roots). So much fun.

Rather than bump-to-hit, the game uses a Hoplite-like positional-movement-based combat system though with a greater variety of moves.  Each enemy type has different attacks and also different levels of vulnerability to the player's moves.  This can be a fair amount to get your head around and as whether or not a given attack will kill an enemy is sometimes randomly decided it can get frustrating.",

The player and monster colors form the basis of a three-stat combat system. Additionally the player can mine the walls to exchange colors at various trade ratios.\n\nThe first thing you'll discover on entering the game is that you can dig walls. Shortly after that you're dead. Digging a black wall costs RGB points for no reward, and most walls are black. So try hard not to accidentally bump into a wall!\n\nThe second thing you'll discover is that you need to press Q, W, and E as many times as necessary to maximize your \"active\" RGB stats, by transferring points from your reserves. This will allow you to survive fights with the monsters. I didn't find any reason not to just keep my active stats topped up at all times.\n\nBeyond that, you wander gargantuan levels hunting for the exit. Killing monsters gives you red, green, or blue color points (almost never red, in my experience), as well as experience points. Leveling up allows you to increase your active stats, which lets you kill monsters more efficiently.\n\nI did not reach full white in my stats; I got to experience level 15 in an hour or more of playing, which let me be 75,75,75 (a dim gray).",

A wall that looked white to me might be described as being green, for instance.\n\nThe map does not show unexplored areas very well, and it doesn't show the location of the exit portal once you discover it!",

I found that I just wanted to keep my stats maxed to the highest amount my level allowed. Perhaps a system that required shifting points between color stats might be more interesting?\n\nMining walls to exchange colors seems cool, but there needs to be more reason to do it other than that monsters don't drop red.\n\nI'd have liked to have seen more extremely-colored enemies from the outset of the game. I'm guessing that the enemy stats on the early levels were low and that's why they all looked black?\n"

The soldiers' spears did not interfere with each other so there was no reason for them not to be close together that I could see. The barbarians move quickly, come from all directions, and the view is zoomed-in so you don't get a lot of advance warning. Thus I did not find much use for the oriented formations.

The Trapped Heart feels like the perfect culmination of this lineage. I was fortunate enough to review the previous incarnation, FireTail. It was good, but it really tested my patience with the insane amount of monster spawning. I have to say that The Trapped Heart knocks FireTail out of the water. There's two sets of abilities here: earthquakes and chain lightning. Both feel very distinct and very powerful. Likewise, the monsters and bosses each have their own unique identities. The theme of friendship is very interesting too, though sometimes it's seems to be tongue or cheek or outright cheesy (\"BRO POWER\"). Early on, I got very frustrated with the game and I assumed it was heavily dependent on luck. As it turned out, I had just spent many hours with the game while not understanding the core mechanics. Even with detailed in game tips, it can be challenging to visualize the effect of each ability. The game might benefit from some sort of visual preview during each turn or even for the abilities themselves. There are certainly some issues with The Trapped Heart (the programmer art for monsters being the most noticeable), but even so this is easily one of the best 7DRLs I have ever played... in any year.

A goblin with a dagger will deal no damage, a goblin with a battle axe will one shot you even in the heaviest of armor. Even within the same enemy + weapon the variance on damage is really high which can still cause dramatic spikes of instantly lethal damage."

I think putting little health bars over the monsters could help; having the damage numbers appear near the monsters could also help; and merging the skill cooldown menu (lower right) with the skill targeting menu (upper right) would help. Showing the skills on NPCs in the status display might help the player learn what kinds of things each monster type can do. Bonus points would be to do some sort of simple animation to show who is injuring whom in the main map view.\n\nSometimes there will be an enemy inside of a skill's plotted area of effect but the game won't let me target them.

So getting close enough to enter the Examine mode, to basically evaluate the enemy's equipment and behaviours, is risky because you could easily step into their attack range and they will disrupt your cloaking device and alert all four enemies of your presence. Your ninja has a melee weapon, so you have to get close to do any damage, and you plan attacks, in a direction, and then select the body part you are aiming at. The attack mode, can be initiated in normal turn time, or inside of the Focus planning mode - where you plan out your actions, movements or attacks, step wise and then can execute the commands one by one. The overly complex meshing of focus mode planning of movements, and adding the attacks to the command list, whilst being aware of the action points available, and trying to match the patrol patterns of the enemy failed mostly.

Should i draw for a high hand or just take a potshot to test the waters?\nEnemies will flee when injured enough, this is nice because in my own narrative I felt like I didn't really want to kill the natives, so I was pleased to be able to force them to flee. Unfortunately sometimes a lucky shot ends up killing them. Don't play with guns, kids!\nGreat flavor text in between levels.\nSometimes the game hangs when generating the next level.",

In terms of gameplay, the main idea was fully there.\n\nThe mechanics create a tactical dynamic wherein positioning and defence are essential. I found myself learning and taking advantage of patterns of enemy positions that would allow me to plow through them unscathed (or at least, not taking more damage than I could recover using healing spells).

I'd love to see the game continued and worked on with not just an extended library of traps, and items that help the player detect and/or defeat them or other encounters as they move from room to room, but also an expansion of NPCs beyond the other (hostile) test subjects and the mysterious old man.",

There is a lot of mystery behind the environment, especially with the old man NPC who I can't help but feel gives out genuine clues I don't know how to even begin deciphering. Unfortunately though, as a room-by-room dungeon crawler the game falls a little behind - there is only the one enemy type and no depth to combat beyond bumping.

Malbolge is the 8th circle of Hell in Dante's inferno and it's not known if it is Turing complete. Gelassenheit is what would happen if the Japanese noise rock band \"the Boredoms\" decided to make a roguelike.\n\nIn Gelassenheit, you have to figure out which symbol represents your character, and you have to figure out what keys make you move in which direction. When I say you \"have to figure it out\" I don't mean you have to look in the manual.

MinotaurRL is game about well known greece myth - Theseus is trapped in labyrinth until he defeat Minotaur; Ariadne gave him magical Thread. Here is first surprise - I didn't expect that Ariadne's Thread will be present in game. But it is, and - together with simple, but really atmospheric tiles - makes game very immersive. Rather grim colour palette enchances impresses. But - would be better if tiles have matching sprite as background instead of just black colour. Due the theme of this game, it's very good that labyrinth is not selfmapping when exploring, but FOV algorithm could be better - there are gaps in wall lightning present. Btw, there are even false / illusion walls in Minotaur's maze! It's nice twist. But not that nice like the core mechanics - glory points. Glory points are your score, and simultaneously there are resource you can spend to make game easier. Using healing powers, or grave robbing make glory fall, and defeating enemies makes glory rise. It's really nice mechanics, it works like choose-own-difficulty-but-don't-expect-high-score-if-you-choose-easy-way. Long word-monster, but - it's how glory works. It's something really innovative, and it's really polished element of mechanics. In general, game is well-balanced, altough ghosts could be more dangerous, because currently you can just look for best equipment from start, without much risk. Default settings are... unhandy. Game runs fullscreen (with rigid resolution), and there are issues about alt-tabbing. In general, MinotaurRL is great 7DRL, and seems be good roguelike just now, even without contest context. It has potential to be really good coffebreak - it just need a bit more content and diversity in gameplay. Maybe some challenge mode?

I definitely feel like at the beginning i need some gear, but its gonna come at a cost!\nControls are OK. I'm a little confused why the Steal Health is on shift+S. Most of the keyboard is unused.\nReadMe states can only move and attack in cardinal directions, however enemies have no trouble meleeing on diagonals. Also if you hit two directions at the same time you can indeed move diagonally :)\nHas a messaging bug which might lead unobservant players astray: steal only removes 10 health, while the text claims 50.

This makes the game divide into 2 phases: 1) Find decent weapons and ammo without alerting the Minotaur, and then  2) fight the Minotaur and hopefully don't get cornered!\nOnce the Minotaur is alerted he becomes a form of hunger clock, which is really neat.\n\n",

    "reviewText": "Polished Coffeebreak game, with a fixed objective, single level, limited health, and uniquely themed monster mechanics. The well designed interface, logo, music, icons all work together to present the Greek Mythology theme very well indeed. Unique mechanics work with each other to change your progress and alter you behaviour, in an almost puzzle like way. With a cloying field of view that leaves no after-sight, means you'll be trying to lay a string trail down to find your way back to the entrance. However, if you step over your trail you break it, and negate its worth, so your path becomes very dependent upon how you \"lay the twine\". Spiders are passive and only attack if you attack them first, they become the primary way to gain glory points when you slay them. Bone piles contain the ghosts of the fallen and usually some  of their equipment. These piles have an age, and the fresher they are, the better the equipment, but the more nastier the ghost is. However, liberated Ghosts will attack the Minotaur if it is neat, so it makes releasing and herding the ghosts a priority if you want help taking down the raging bull. Once the Minotaur sees you he will chase you down. So you have to race back to the entrance, using ghosts to help you attack him, and trying not to follow a path to a dead end. Very tense and enjoyable action in a bitesize session. You can ease the difficulty on the fly, by stealing some health off the Minotaur directly, but you will lose glory in doing so. Overall the game is an interesting balancing puzzle between all the mechanics and living to get back to the exit of the Labyrinth. An excellent first effort for a 7DRL!",

So it retains the strategy that the forced move design aims to create, without the feeling of unfairness.\nThe strict hunger clock is balanced and serves its purpose well.

This is an ambitious project replicating what seems like a lot of what other Pokemon games are based on in terms of capturing and developing monsters and pitting them against each other. Whilst there's a lot of good content here, an element of fun is still lacking and I'm not yet convinced that expanding away from the simpler and purer presentations I've seen in the original Pokemon games into a roguelike style is adding enough fun. This is nonetheless a solid start which would be worth developing further. Maybe it would have been better to reduce the scope slightly and spend more time balancing, then expand later? (I say that but am guilty myself of the opposite often enough) Please add diagonal movement (maybe that's been done already, haven't played the post-7DRL versions yet) :)",

    "ft": "Less fun than I anticipated. I don't understand why I can't move diagonally especially as I get attacked diagonally and because I need to position myself to heal my pokemon with potions or capture others with pokeballs. I didn't really feel that having the pokemon fight on a tactical roguelike map was that interesting or more fun compared to the simplified interface of the original pokemon games. I can imagine there's scope for the battlemap to make more difference but now it was more frustrating than fun. Often enough my weakling pokemons just perished unceremoniously whilst I was trying to place myself to help them. Just throwing out and withdrawing various pokemon is not very fun. I had most success by camping near a town, going out into the nearest area to do one fight and then retreating back to have everyone healed. The boss fight was buggy for me because once I had recalled my pokemon once I was never able to deploy any pokemon again in the gym because it kept saying the it was a one on one battle. This sapped some fun too. But this definitely has potential and I could see a neat, balanced, challenging game emerging as long as the actual pokebattles are made more interesting and worth having on a map."

This is clearly Civ with a few twists and I kept mentally comparing it to Civ, which is a pretty high bar to reach. On the one hand, it's nice to be able to go wherever you want, but actually not being able to do so immediately in Civ is what *motivates* you to build and explore. My big gripe here is the way the islands work. You can use remote islands to generate cash but that seems to be the only link to any other place. But generating gold is so easy! There doesn't seem to be a hunger clock that keeps you on you toes and so I would often just hold down the wait key until I was rich. Then winning a level simply requires going to barbarian lands and building cities just outside of the FOV of the enemies. If you're too close, they'll crush you right away. If the island was too small, this task seemed impossible. Ships would be nice (maybe that was the idea behind the teleporter?). It's cool to be able to fight alongside your units, but you really only can take a finite number of hits before that option is closed off permanently."
