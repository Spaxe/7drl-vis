Even has a save system, in-game readme, monsterpedia and goes to main menu on death - little details that make all the difference.\n    2 - Runs without error and seems well polished all around, but having some sort of music or sound effects would make it immaculate\n    2 - Some monsters and effects take two characters (on Linux), that looks a bit weird... Other than that, I do not see any bugs, but I do not think it is polished, either.",
    "at": "3 - Excellent controls and clear visuals. ASCII but *done right*. Good colour choices and the whole game feels responsive. Primarily keyboard control, with optional mouse support (feels a bit better to use mouse for targetting).\n    3 - Provided easy to understand controls and was very easy to get the hang of controls and what was going on\n    2 - Typical roguelike",
    "ft": "3 - Wow, so compelling! The difficulty is on the hard side of perfect, which is quite frankly perfect. The variety of monsters throughout the levels makes it really engaging on every playthrough. Intrinsically fun game and one of the best by far this year.\n    3 - Taking over other bodies and trying out new skills is a lot more engaging than I expected. Every enemy provides a variety of actions, and there is a lot of variety.\n    2 - Okay, but nothing special.",
    "it": "3 - There a number of innovations here, but the central possession mechanic really stands out and has been implemented with flair. Having different abilities from all enemies is great, and the corpse explosions and other details all add to the experience.\n    3 - It adds a level of play, taking over enemies, that I never would have expected. The level of existence as different enemies makes the otherwise drole roguelike play very interesting in a way that I haven't seen before\n    2 - I do not see any major innovation here, but it is not just like some other game I know either.",
    "st": "3 - There are a *lot* of different enemies in the game, and most of them do really feel different and special. On top of that each one has a unique and well-written description. So much depth of detail here, and alongside the great interface and good balancing it's really amazing that this was done in just 7 days - bravo!\n    3 - This game has a lot of variety of enemies, as well as maps and skills. Many mechanics were well thought-out and implemented smoothly, making the overall experience that much better. There is a lot of flavoring as well, such as blood and bodies\n    2 - many types of monsters, with special abilities. A strong \"2\".",
    "rt": "3 - Turn-based procedural permadeath game that emphasises thoughtful moves and tactical combat. Quintessentially roguelike.\n    3 - Everything about this game is roguelike, as far as the core mechanics go.\n    3 - Yes, I think it is a roguelike.",
    "reviewText": "I've never rated a game all 3s before, but this is a truly deserving title! I had to tear myself away from the game to write this review... Possession puts you in the role of a ghost that must possess enemies and use their abilities to progress. With many enemy types and many abilities to harness this becomes very interesting indeed. The game is hard, but in a good way, and it rewards careful play and thoughtful learning of its systems. On top of being a great game it's also polished to a high shine and very nicely balanced. This is really a joy to play on all levels.\n    This game is a very well-done Roguelike, and I look forward to playing it even more after reviewing it. The amount of variety, as well as the novelty of the idea itself, make the game fun to play and something I would recommend to anyone that wants to play a fun 7DRL creation.\n    As the name suggests, this game is based on possession.You start as a \"ghost\" who can possess monster bodies, and you get other powers if you do possess one. I have reached depth 2 (which is 80% of the game as far as I understand)."

I normally would not give a game a 3 if this occurred, but the rest of the game is so finely crafted and complete that even with this strange bug I cannot but give this game a perfect score. One funny 'bug' is that this game is spelled wrong on the 7DRL download site, so is being reviewed under a mispelled name. Note I was definitely playing the final bug fix version.",
    "at": "3 - great pixel art, intuitive, customizable controls\n    3 - Looks great. Graphics are retro without actually being \"retro\". Nice to look at. Lots of nice little touches like animated status effects and TVs that change images.\n    3 - Some of the best aesthetics in the competition. Beautiful pixel art and a constantly visible inventory. A moderate amount of key commands is forgivable.",
    "ft": "2 - a complete fallout-like game. Would get a 3 if it wasn't so hard. \n    2 - Lots of fun but for me it was way too hard. Especially the start of the game before you have any decent equipment. Frustrating, but rewarding once you build up a bunch of resources. Would be nicer to start with at least a medpack or grenade or some other kind of 'emergency' item. Constant approach of the unstoppable alien monster is a great touch. Would be awesome if the different 'color' enemies hated each other, would make the early game easier by being able to (for example) lead a bunch of cyan robots into a gang of punks and/or yellow mutants.\n    2 - What keeps this game from being nearly perfect is the difficulty curve. I've played it many times and have not been able to get past the early game. This may be a reflection more on me than anything to do with the author, but after 20+ runs you'd think I'd luck out at some point and find some great gear. Waiting for a lucky run is not a fun thing. Difficulty is not a bad thing, but feeling like you cannot progress becomes frustrating.",
    "it": "2 - the core gameplay is a classic turn by turn tactical rpg. There are some innovative \"spells\"/effects though.\n    2 - Nothing crazy here but the elements that are here are polished to an absolute shine. The constant approach of the unstoppable alien monster is not something I have seen before, feels like a very roguelike-y way to drive the player forward.\n    2 - This is a chase and collection game, not incredibly innovative but definitely well done.",
    "st": "3 - hardly believable for a 7DRL. It's obviously using a very polished game engine. \n    3 - Very ambitious, beyond what I would expect for a 7DRL.\n    3 - The different enemy types, gear and enemy powers is far above average.",
    "rt": "3 - turn by turn, procedural generation, instadeath\n    3 - Don't let the amazing art fool you, this is definitely a roguelike. Twist on the 'hunger' clock is very roguelikey and fun. Maybe a BIT too difficult in the early game, but that is hardly an un-roguelikey thing.\n    3 - Procedural content, permadeath, inventory managment, tile/grid based play, turn based...it hits all the major roguelike qualities.",
    "reviewText": "A feature-full, good looking, 8bits tactical rpg. Think XCom meets Fallout. Inventory, quick skill slots, cinematics, objectives with a map, it has everything. The only downside is the insanely high difficulty. As soon as a group of punks sees you, you're as good as dead. I didn't find a way to get enough equipment to be able to survive more than 5 minutes.\n    Amazingly detailed and graphically polished, but brutal early game can be off-putting. Rogue City Scavenger really captures the feel of a post-apocalyptic city, with burning cars, and punks, and grafitti and burned out buildings everywhere. Very pleasing to look at. Easy and intuituve to play. Pro-tip: don't fight anything except punks until you have tons of ammo and a decent melee weapon. Stay away from red and yellow buildings until you can easily clear out a cyan one.\n    This is a very complete and complex roguelike by Numeron, a veteran of the 7DRL challenge. This game has everything you'd want from a good 7DRL, fast pace, lots of variety and even neat little graphics. The game is pressed ever forward by the presence of a super tough lizard man slowly stalking you. You can heal up each turn, but you cannot just hang out and heal since the lizard man will find and kill you eventually. It all comes together well and is a highly recommended game, the only issue is that it's just hard as heck."

For example one of the basic items you pick up is just called \"magic\" which seemed like a name bug until I read the docs.\n    2 - There were some bugs when we first go going on dungeons, it seemed like turns piled up and then went off all at once. Perhaps that was just our own fault as we didn't account for the lag correctly.\n    3 - Runs pretty great right out of the box.",

The controls are well documented and easy to get.\n    2 - Except for some overloaded symbols things mostly made sense. Nice color choices.\n    3 - Everything seemed well explained. I was tempted to give this a 2 as there is not anything truly exceptional about the control and feedback. But for this being the first MMO roguelike I've every played it was trivial to figure out and get into, and that very much is something exceptional.\n    2 - Solid classic terminal ASCII. I wish there was a way to see who was on once you log on other than calling out in chat (like the tab function in Minecraft), Controls can be a bit buggy - I can use numpad to move but in 'Z look mode' I need to use arrow keys on Windows 7. Chat has an invisible hard character limit, which is also less than helpful in some situations.",

The ability to create custom towns is kinda cool too.\n    1 - Currently too buggy to be much fun. Also slow mode for multiplayer is frustrating and fast mode is basically insta-death.\n    3 - Super fun, lots to do. The MMO genre is great because it allows you to dink around on the web with your friends. I really like that. This also allows an interesting crafting game for solo play, which is great.\n    3 - Lots to explore and do, including an infinite resource gathering area and multiple deep and interesting dungeons. I'm sure it could get even more fun with the right group working together.",

I am not sure if the mechanic would become annoying in the long run (waiting for party messages could be irritating), but it worked in the short play through I did. The crafting/skill system is also quite cool.\n    3 - Not the first multiplayer roguelike but has some nice features such as a safe resource gathering area and player unique building spaces.\n    3 - This would be a 3 for the solo game. Add the MMO aspect leaves you wishing you could give a score of 4.\n    3 - While multiplayer RLs have been tried before (my very first roguelike experience was ToMENet, actually), this still brings some interesting innovations to multiplayer play, like the keyed towns/storage, plus some neat crafting/skill mechanics.",
    "st": "3 - Between the multiplayer, persistent towns, new crafting/skill system, and overall polish, this was beyond what you'd see in a typical 7drl.\n    3 - Most of the problems with completeness and fun come from the scope being so large in this game. There's a couple of different core mechanics that are nice ideas but don't match up very well, such as the \"crafting\" and combat.\n    3 - An above average amount of gameplay content. It's not the strongest '3' in the competition, there are games with more elements, but this one has enough to easily earn the top rating.\n    3 - Fully functional multiplayer roguelike with an innovative skill mechanic!",
    "rt": "3 - Permadeath, random dungeon gen, grid-based, turn-based (even with multiplayer), this game is clearly a roguelike.\n    3 - Very roguelike, ASCII with turn based gameplay as well as permadeath.\n    3 - Classic procedural, turn based, permadeath, resource management, single character strategy game. With all the ancillary tropes of ASCII presentation, dungeon diving, fantasy theme, bump interactions etc, etc...\n    3 - Permadeath, tactically lots to do, randomly generated dungeons, and manages to be both multiplayer and turn based.",
    "reviewText": "This game is definatly worth checking out. Be sure to get a buddy on the server at the same time so you can toy around with the turn-based multiplayer. While in a non-safe zone (one with monsters), all player get to make a move, then the monsters. This means that the party can take its time and chat about the best next moves, but quickly move through dungeon when needed. The crafting/skill system is also quite nice. You do not level up as with most roguelikes, but instead you spend experience on helpful skills.\n    This game has a lot of nice ideas and potential but overreached its scope and fails to be much fun in practice. The addition of player customizable spaces is a really nice idea but doesn't add to the core gameplay. If you're planning on making a multiplayer roguelike then mmoRL is worth checking out to see what's done well and what could be improved upon.\n    This game is my 'holy cow' moment of this 7DRL competition. It's not the funnest game, the most in depth or the most polished this year, but all around this is the best game. It succeeds where so many have failed, it executes that rare holy grail of game design, the massively multiplayer roguelike game. Sure there are some bugs and rough spots here and there, and I hope the developer sees the positive feeback and smooths out some things, but this game does succeed in its goal. This game makes me wish my friends were into roguelikes, but they just aren't. So sad.\n    This is a really impressive and surprising game. Still minorly buggy - working in multiplayer was harder than it looked, and I had some control issues - but there's a lot of great potential here, and that crafting mechanic is strangely captivating. Grab some friends and check it out!"

Controls work very well on Android tablet.\n    3 - Nice minimalist pixel graphics, with some subtle animation effects that add a lot.  Controls work well and the built-in tutorial is good at getting you up to speed very quickly.  It would be nice if you could travel more than one tile at a time especially after all enemies have been defeated, since it becomes a bit irritating to have to tap lots of times to move over to the altar/exit, but that's only a minor quibble.",

Tight mechanics! Deterministic! This really ticks every box I like. It also works perfectly for mobile, which is exceedingly rare for roguelikes.\n    3 - Really good.  The interesting movement-based combat mechanics and the nicely differentiated abilities of the different enemy types give it a real chess-like feel where you must choose your every move with utmost care.

    "st": "2 - Probably hit the nail on the head for a simple pick-me-up game and just scrapes home on the replayability side of things. \n    2 - Pretty good, but not overwhelming scope. Single 18 floor dungeon, with each floor the size of a very large room. Tight combat makes it seem denser though.\n    2 - Very well put together and with a well thought-out set of character progression options.  I would have liked to see a little more complexity in the ganeration of the 'dungeon'/board and a few more different enemy types appearing in the late game would have been nice however I may just be being greedy there.",
    "rt": "1 - Not a roguelike for me - has tatical turn-based elements but that is it.\n    3 - Turn-based, permadeath, tactical combat. Has some procedural elements to the levels but these don't impact hugely on play.\n    3 - Although very different to most roguelikes in implementation, for me it still captures the fundamental feel of the genre.",
    "reviewText": "The game starts out with a tutorial and then drops you straight into the action. This is no searching here; the game screen shows everything, monsters, temples and the exit. The screen is simple and effective and magma placement allows slight tactic changes between levels. Each monster has different abilities and needs to be dealt with differently, highlighted by the hexagonal grid. The temples are a novel and very necessary part of the game, rewarding you with upgraded abilities or restoration. However the choice of upgrade is up to the player, making it interesting when you are tossing up between a new ability or badly needed restoration. The subtleties of the combat system become more apparent as you play through the levels, particularly the difference between a stab and lunge. I found it to be a fun, fast paced turn-based game, the only thing this game is missing is sound and music.  Finished it after a few goes, quite rewarding experience.\n    Android roguelike with tight combat mechanics. You can't bump to attack - you must either lunge from a distance, move along the side of an enemy to swipe it, or take clever advantage of their attack patterns to make them kill each other. It's initially quite approachable but quickly the challenge ramps up against multiple enemies of different abilities. Very satisfying and engaging and perfect for mobile play. One of the highlights of this year, and indeed one of the very best mobile roguelikes around right now.\n    A real hidden gem, in fact I think this may be my personal favourite 7DRL of 2013 from those I have played so far.  The combat system is highly tactical with a lot of things to think about and a good deal of depth.  The greek mythology theme is well realised and suits the game well (with the possible exceptions of green slimes and the bomb-throwing guys) and basing the rewards around different gods is a great idea.  My only real complaint is that it could use a little more variety, perhaps achieved though a greater range of different tile types and enemies."

Huge replay value.\n    3 - great, challenging game with really innovative mechanisms\n    2 - Once I got over the brief learning curve I had fun jumping about and setting myself challenges like a pacifist run. Good replay value, but too often star systems are simply refuel at the gas giant and hightail it out, rarely needing to interact with other ships or bases. It definately gets more interesting once you get the Genesis Device which kills your cloak, but thats half the game in.",

The exchange rates are such as require difficult decision-making and strategy.  It's not a new concept, but it's extremely well-done.  The cloaking mechanic is great too, and by the time you can get to the Genesis Device you've learned to rely on it.  Then, just as you're getting the hang of the game, you get the Device and it disables your cloak!  Brilliant twist.\n    3 - Great game design that manage to mix standard roguelike gameplay (overmap, potions, melee fighting) with a totally unfitting star trek setting.

    "reviewText": "This is the best game I've played in a while.  I can't think of anything bad to say about it.  There are a few rough spots: sometimes the map display leaked into the right panel, and the help file could be better integrated with the interface.  But with the help file open in another window, the game was not nearly as hard to learn as the author seemed to think it would be.  An individual game takes a few minutes at most, which makes the learning curve more tolerable: when you learn by doing not to attack a tanker in a system full of merchants and starbases, you don't actually lose much when you have to start over.  That's another feature that I haven't seen much: rather than gathering resources to reach your goal, you actually start out in KRL with as many resources as you'll ever have, and you have to replenish them along the way.  It doesn't sound that different, but it gives the game a very distinctive feel.\n    Not a 7DRL entry, but a real, complete, challenging little game. Its strength is its game design, its weakest part, the visuals. All in all, it's really worth a try. \n    Sneak your way out into Federation space, steal their Genesis Device and get on back with the Federation on your tail! This is a well designed stealth and resource management game, with FTL overtones and an awesomely hectic second act. Many actions you take will drop you out of stealth alerting the local dangers and merchants, and giving them a brief window in which to react to your presence. This means approaching resources at good angles and having an escape route ready. Combat is very simple, you are weak defensively but strong in attack, so if you have the ammo you can take on the world, but it is severely limited and often better used to trade for repairs so usually its best to bail. This is a well balanced game with good replayability, so make sure you check it out."

But, this is a MINOR nitpick. \n    2 - Fun once you get the hang of things. Lots of enemies around who you generally want to avoid. Sometimes just not so fun running away or trying to avoid enemies. There isn't really a stealth mechanic, which might improve the fun of this type of game.",
    "it": "3 - It's really something fresh. It's not your typical stealth game, as you walk on streets in open, and it's not your typical hack&slash, as you kill people only if absolutely necessary.\n    3 - Complex mission structures are rather rare in roguelikes. The interity of the alertness/crime system is very innovative as well. Well worth playing and checking out, even if you are only going to steal the ideas!\n    3 - An interesting take on roguelikes and strategy games. Lots of depth here and even a story behind it (inspired by sci-fi novels).",
    "st": "2 - Just enough for 7 days. The core idea was implemented, but there wasn't enough time to grow more meat around it. Couple more missions and probably some equipment variety, and it could be 3.\n    2 - Solid scope for a 7DRL. Definitely on the HIGH side, could be a 3 for someone else.\n    3 - A lot of depth and strategy. Pretty impressive for 7 days. More development time could really deepen the gameplay.",
    "rt": "3 - It's closer to roguelike then roguelike-like. There is great random city generator, it is turn based, there is permadeath and combat.\n    3 - Definitely a roguelike!\n    3 - 100% roguelike",
    "reviewText": "There is one thing in a game, that is hard to notice, but it is there. All citizens aren't just for show. They have their own AI, they are sleeping, eating and walking to work. It doesn't affect gameplay. But it's still nice thing to know. It adds something to atmosphere. Police do not cheat with information sharing. If policeman havn't seen that you commited the crime, he might be alerted, but won't shoot at you right away. As long as noone alive remembered your face, you can get away with your crimes. You can walk thru police that is rushing toward crime scene, turn around the corner and hide in the nearby house. The game is a little unbalanced, as game difficulty can vary from very easy to instadeath, depending on position of police stations relative to starting and/or target points.\n    The game is very TENSE... it is a rare quality in a roguelike. You will find yourself murdering civilians that have seen your face, for the greater good of course! Interesting alert/crime systems force you to make interesting strategic decisions. Mission structure is well done and relatively clear. The radar is a bit buggy, but a tip: move one step in both directions (e.g. NE, move N then E) it says and re-check radar. Basic terminal colors are used very well, recommend playing on the lower resolution you can stand, so you don't miss any details.\n    Very solid entry in this year's competition. A sci-fi roguelike in which you play a sabateuor trying to sneak around a heavily patrolled city and plant bombs. Some Star Wars elements and themes, interesting technology stuff that helps it stand apart from the usual D&D roguelikes."

This is a brutally fun real time roguelike (-like) that draws a lot of inspiration from the Binding of Isaac. This game seriously has professional-level polish. Great music, super sharp original graphics, tight controls. Great implementation of roguelike systems into a realtime game. (Just be careful not to fall off the map!)

One time after I died, pressing enter didn't actually restart the game like it usually does.  I got trapped in another dimension once after using Ice Blink.",

Check out the subtle markings on the floors of the mystical rooms.\n    3 - It's so attractive, it even comes with an attract mode! The spell effects are nice, especially the magic missile. The UI is pick-up-and-play clean, tested by complete roguelike newbies too. However, the play window is rather small, and looks terrible when scaled up, making it difficult to actually see what you're doing (monsters in burning doors are particularly difficult to see)\n    3 - Very nice ASCII graphics and colored tiles/symbols.  The rooms each have their own style - antimagic rooms have runes on the floor, a guard barracks has a faint \"g\" on the floor, etc.  Clearly a lot of thought and effort was put into the look and feel of the game.",
    "ft": "3 - Yes, it's very fun. I started again after beating it because I wanted to experiment more with the spells.\n    3 - Very challenging and beautifully balanced. The starting spells can get you to places, but not sustainably so, so you're pushed to gather and figure out how to best use new spells before the castle wears you down. \n    2 - The choices you have in each encounter make the game pretty compelling, although the bugs can be frustrating.

A healing spell might accidentally heal your opponent, or a fire spell might light the room on fire and trap you.  This adds a lot of depth to the decisions you make as you play.",

Everything fits into the game nicely.\n    3 - It mightn't be a Vicious Orcs-type sprawling mass of content, but after several hours of play I'm pretty sure I still haven't plumbed its depths fully. I only just saw my first enemy wizard.\n    2 - The author clearly chose a single focus - the spells - and developed entirely around that.  There are only a few kinds of enemies, no leveling system, and no loot besides new spell scrolls.  However, there's definitely variety in the spells and the rooms you encounter.",
    "rt": "3 - Yes.\n    3 - No resource management (beyond managing your HP, and your invisible HP maximum) and a very simple append-only inventory, but otherwise very roguelikey. Deserves particular props for forcing the player to move fast in a very natural way simply by pressuring them with respawns and having no heal-over-time (besides healing methods that don't instantly heal you fully, there is at least one such spell)\n    2 - There's only one level, and no experience or equipment, but it still has a very roguelike feel.",
    "reviewText": "This game is great! The timing system takes some getting used to, so you'll take a few extra attacks at first. The process of figuring out how the spells and traps work was quite enjoyable. Recommended.\n    Cream of this year's 7DRL crop, this is a game where very soon after you start every move begins to count. Pugnacious Wizards has you attack a castle filled with guards, archers, and many different sorts of traps (from your basic exploding tiles on the floor to spinning arrow-throwing towers and walls that fill whole rooms with arrows). At your side are your spells, of which you get three guaranteed ones at the start, and can randomly find more inside the castle. Each spell can be cast with no limit besides being castable once per turn. It seems like the starting Fire Jump should make you incredibly powerful, but the castle turns out to be more dangerous than you might expect. As enemies both respawn inside barracks rooms, and rise from the dead as skeletons, you're constantly pushed onward as fast as you can muster. I've managed to loot myself two of the three amulet pieces and have to sleep, but I know I will be coming back to this game. Tomorrow. The day after tomorrow. How long? Who knows...\n    Definitely one of the more interesting 7DRLs this year.  Pugnacious Wizards is focused entirely on spellcasting.  The goal of the game is to get through a fortress filled with traps, guards, and archers.  Spells can be cast freely and without needing any kind of \"mana\" resource, but each spell has a potential cost.  Magic missiles bounce unpredictably and can hit you accidentally, healing spells reduce your stats permanently or heal enemies around you, freezing spells often freeze you as well, etc.  These tradeoffs make choosing which spell to use in which situation a very compelling decision.  The game's main weaknesses are a few very frustrating bugs, most notably that the screen doesn't update after you take an action, but only after you begin your next action (I assume this is a bug and not by design?).  This is especially frustrating when you teleport to a new position, only to find that your line of sight doesn't redraw until your next action.  Maybe I'm missing something and this is intentional, but I doubt it.  Overall, however, Pugnacious Wizards is a lot of fun and definitely worth trying out.  (One additional note:  The game plays a demo screen before you begin, so if you go to the author's blog and scroll through his 7DRL posts you can see the evolution of the game play out before your eyes - very cool to watch!)"

Controls are simple enough, though I wish I could inspect things with the keyboard.\n    3 - It declares itself a cyberpunk hacking game and it fits the general look. The colours are done well and the interface is fairly clear. The enemies have a distinct, kind of cute style, and the information popups are clear. The style is consistant and endering.\n    2 - Graphics are a little garish and busy for my tastes but they suit the theme well so it's hard to hold it against it.  Almost a 3, but the controls and the meanings of many of the symbols and numbers embedded in the graphics are unclear and take a lot of trial and error to figure out.  'Use the mouse and keyboard' is not particularly helpful!",

Compared to the other thinking and planning games on show, this one seems different in that you can line yourself up against whatever challenge you think you can handle. Since abilities and points are all up for grabs should you choose to pay the price, the risk analysis goes far deeper than just figuring out the safest path to the end of the level.\n    2 - I had to alt-tab to the game instructions a couple of times during my first play, but after I understood what I was supposed to be doing, I did rather enjoy my playtime. It's a simple and fun game.\n    3 - Could do with a bit more explanation to begin with, but once the complexities become apparent it is a very fun game with a lot of depth.  It is occasionally frustrating when despite your best efforts a bunch of fast enemies teleport in nearby and quickly beat you to a bloody (well, bitty) pulp, though it does usually feel like your own fault for not investing in an ability to deal with such situations.",

I do feel bad having to mark it down for that, but I didn't invent this scoring system!",
    "reviewText": "This amazing puzzle game will see you traversing an abstract cyber environment, clearing a board of various viruses and combatant programs, then ciphoning out resources and new abilities. Good abilities are tantalisingly on display even from the first level, but choosing to pick one up will generate a number enemies relative to the strength of the ability, so its important to maintain self control and power up only if you can handle the consequences. Adding spice to the combat, waiting a turn is one of the abilities to aquire, so careful planning is nessecary to effectively deal with all aspects of your actions. Don't let the initial hurdles get in your way because this game is definately up there with the best this year.\n    I really enjoyed this, despite it being at about demo-level. It's well excecuted, good visuals, and good gameplay. It has so much potential, and I'm really looking forward to the update.\n    Neuromancer: the roguelike.  A very innovative, very interesting, very fun, very polished game.  The theme is a good match to the abstract gameplay and the highly positional combat and resource-gathering mechanics complement each other well and give the game a great deal of strategic depth.  The only real issue with the game is that the mechanics are not very obvious and take a long time to figure out - it could be improved greatly by the inclusion of more explanation and instruction."

Gameplay wise most of the usual roguelike systems are here. The abilities system is extensive and does a good job of offering lots of choice without overwhelming the player.\n    I think that lots of effort has been put into this roguelike. It looks really great, and has lots of features. But it also has misfeatures: I am unable to use weapons, some features do not work or are not finished, it seems unbalanced (but maybe this is just me - I die about Level 2).

    "rt": "3 - Combining the ASCII characters on the tiles and making the game clock only progress while you move feels very roguelike, even if other features like an inventory / equipment system are missing entirely.\n    2 - Would be a 3 if random level generation has been implemented.\n    2 - I'm tempted to give this a 3, but the procedural generation is not so robust, there's no real strategic use of resources either.",
    "reviewText": "Worth playing! The basic movement and time passing mechanic works very well and the strategy elements are novel and fun. A variation on the Triangle Wizard theme except time only passes when you move and you can choose how quickly you move.\n    A neat implemention of a 'gridless' roguelike, where time only passes when you're moving.  The base mechanics are pretty fun, and dodging missiles is great, especially when you can direct them into other enemies.  However there are minor irritations; it is easy to get stuck on walls and the melee mechanics do not feel very clean.  The game also needs a little more to it in order to be more than a temporary distraction.\n    This is a game about running away from bad guys, trying to get them to shoot each other, and sometimes bumping them to death. The real interesting thing here is the timing mechanic. It's not an 'I go, you go' system but rather a simultaneous real time system. So if you are moving, the baddies are as well. It's a fun game with an arcade like feel, plays pretty quick too. Definitely recommended."

    "reviewText": "This is why so few rogulikes are about kids on an island - it's hard. Quite fun and different - but hard. Die from starvation. Die from lack of sleep. Die from a cold because you were in the rain too long. Die from scrapes from walking through bushes. Die from stubling around in the dark. Die from kids cutting your throat. I'm not even sure how I died sometimes. Trying to find out why your father hasn't returned from this island is very tough. There's a few items that can help you, but you can't expect to win with your starting supplies. If you like survivor-like games with strong themes, or want to try something a little different, this is easily worth trying.\n    Borstal has a nice little story and the gamplay and atmosphere to support it. Doesn't take too long to figure out and beat, so it's well worth time time it takes to do so. It keeps a record of wins and losses, but after winning once I didn't feel like playing again (I'd lost several times previously, including at the final encounter). The only part that's frustrating is that getting the equipment you need is rather random and you get sick in the rain easily while the game chastises you for being in the rain you can't avoid. Do get the download version though as the web version is painfully slow.\n    Borstal is a survival horror roguelike where you have to manage your rest, food, and light while avoiding injury and illness on a eerie island in an effort to save your father. As you wander the single, but procedurally-generated, level you encounter some of the island's residents and caches of supplies as you draw closer to the juvenile correctional facility where your father works. The game is an interesting experiment, you can explore to find food, but eating food or resting have rather unpredictable results. The game is frustrating at first, but once you understand the mechanics, you should be able to bring it to a quick somewhat satisfying conclusion."

The most notable is a crash which happens if the player happens to be inside the acid ball attack (just add self.name='You' to the Player init and it is fixed).\n    3 - The game is complete and bugfree.",

E.g., the comma, period, and both enter keys should all be usable to select something.\n    2 - Normally I prefer ascii to tiles, but in this game the ascii was pretty ugly. The tiles looked okay though. The controls were intuitive. Given that the game works with vi-keys, num-pad, and mouse, pretty much everyone will find the controls fairly intuitive. There were a few exceptions though: only one enter worked, which will be annoying to num-pad users. The game uses 'c' for help...or controls I guess.\n    3 - There are tiles and ascii displays.

But when I tried to write what is innovative here I understood that it is an insects setting wrapped around pretty much standard gameplay ideas. You need to find items to progress to next level. You have to deal with dumb AI controlled allies. That was done before. You can change ants trying to find food with rebel army agent trying to steal nuclear warheads from imperial storehouse. Just replace workants with cargo drones, ant holes with sewers hatches, mana with energy, acid spit with plasma blast, etc.",

Tiles are nice, but as far as I can tell there were 3 people working on this, so I guess it's ok for 7 days.",

As I mentioned, I didn't get past level 3: the main way to regain HP is to eat other bugs (awesome) and very rare fruit items, but you inevitably lose HP in combat, so I always found myself with no way to avoid dying.  Some way to heal, perhaps an MP-intensive ability, would very much help playability.\n    You should definatly check out this game. The basic idea is that you are an ant, leading other ants in your colony to food. You are assailed by other assorted bugs and you must protect yourself and your allies from them using various abilities such as spitting acid. The game is somewhat challenging and will take a few play throughs to get the hang of, so there is some limited replay value.\n    I'm a little disappointed with this one. Description said something about smell and how ants are searching for food. But the only ability related to smell is ability that blocks path for workers with stench, which is used extremely rarely. I used it only once when worker ant started to bump into the wall trying to reach ant hole on the other side."

The random placement within maps works quite well with its aesthetic choices of ASCII characters as part of the wall and background tiles.\n\n\n    A solid entry in this year's competition. Fun, though perhaps not that innovative or original. Very similar to many classic arcade-style dungeon crawls from the past but with some roguelike elements thrown in. Browser-based, too, making it easy to fire up and jump right into.\n    This game is a fine example of a roguelike shooter. If you are into action based play, shooting, exploration, dodging, grinding up xp and loot and upgrading your tank/character then this is the game for you. It has quite a few levels, is challenging and there is significant depth in how you can upgrade your character."

    "reviewText": "This game is based on cubes in three dimensional space, up/down left/right is all relative. Navigation was a bit tricky, even if you got your head around which way you are going, not enough of the map was visible at a time. However this can be part of the fun, but leads to some claustrophobic unavoidable encounters in later levels. I found myself getting swamped by enemies especially if I was unlucky enough not to get many attack upgrades. Luckily the fast paced gameplay lets me get back into the action as soon as I die. The two sides of the coin was a nice concept combined with the coloured enemies, allowing positional tactics to come into play. Unfortunately there is no real difference between the wizard and barbarian, other than colour, some other tactical choices would of been good here, especially against the non-coloured enemies. I found the game really frustrating before I learnt how to change characters for a given square (to allow selective pickup), this skill is vital. This game was quite fun, and challenging, definitely worth a play.\n    The game is aesthetically pleasing, but the essence of the game is to kill all the enemies on a given level before you can proceed. However the game appears more of a puzzle game than a roguelike, but it is still a fun little game.\n    Double Rogue presents a brilliant concept: your character is actually a fuse of two! Every step you make switches between them. Sadly, this is where the ingenuity ends. Since the game is 3D you can assure every bonus goes to only one of characters by traversing planes in certain way and it is optimal way to play. This works against the game because it minimizes the double-character aspect."

You'd expect a game like this to have all kinds of wonky work arounds, all kinds of strange 'programmery' type things but it doesn't. You can occasionally click the wrong field and accidently start typing over data, but simply hit escape and the problem is solved. This game has quite a bit of fun packed in, 3 character classes, weapons, fruit, enemies with a variety of behavior. It's also hard as nails.

Especially seeing as there is multiple levels, yet I never completed more than one due to running out.\nNevertheless, this is a great game design-wise, and has the cutest pixel art of Gelatinous Cubes I have seen so far. As short as it might be, it's 100% pure fun. Go, Gelatinous! Make the world a little more jelly, step by step!\n    The game is quite polished with simple and clean graphics, and it was quite enjoyable to play. Two complaints are the movement/time bar depleting even when not moving, and the repeat delay is a little long. It does not appear to fit into the roguelike genre, but still a fun little game.\n    This little flash game is definitely worth a coffee break or two (or three). You play as a gelatinous cube, and you are tasked with ridding the dungeon of pesky adventurers. Adventurers have great abilities like the wizard who throws fireballs and the cleric who (obnoxiously) revives your dead victims. Time limit continuously pushes you to take risks... sitting around the corner and mashing space will not get you very far. Graphics are polished to a shine and the controls are super intuitive.

The colonists' names drawing from a library of notable podcasters was a nice touch.  The game won't fit in a resolution of 1360x768, so I had to scroll my browser around a bit in order to see everything.  Also, moving one square at a time with the arrow keys got painful quickly given the amount of back-and-forth movement the game requires.\n    3 - neat, clear ASCII. Pods are apparently supposed to be identified before being picked up, but this accomplished with different shades of grey rather than clear text.",
    "ft": "2 - It's definitely tricky and very enjoyable.\n    2 - The concept - save colonists with a variety of occupations, origins and genders in order to save the colony mission - starts out seeming like a lot of fun.  Unfortunately, the gameplay gets extremely repetitive very quickly.  Once you figure out the optimal way to play the game, there's really no room for decision making or for the game to surprise you.\n    2 - Running time-limited errands while zapping zombies. Unfortunately, even with good strategy the challenge level is inconsistent, depending too strongly on the positioning of the drop-off points.",
    "it": "2 - It challenges RL conventions in a nice way. Yeah, there's your typical running around the dungeon and fighting monsters, but the whole system with the pods and such gives it a unique spin and changes your gameplay goal.\n    3 - The concept for the game is very original, and I was excited when I first read it.  I think the concept of rescuing colonists with different abilities and backgrounds is an excellent idea and could be the basis for a much deeper game.\n    2 - Delivery quests strongly linked to resource management and combat.",
    "st": "2 - Yeah, typical 7DRL scope.\n    2 - The game doesn't stray far beyond very basic gameplay.  It would have been nice to see a bit more variety.  However, what's there is well polished, and the game includes interesting level generation, lighting, and a random name generator.\n    2 - Content on different levels differs only in numbers and map layout. Levels apparently continue until you rescue your quota of humans.",
    "rt": "3 - Even with all the innovative mechanics,  this is still a roguelike at its heart, and it shows.\n    3 - The gameplay feels very much roguelike, even if there is no real player advancement and the combat takes a back seat to collecting colonists.\n    3 - Permanent death and procedural content on a discrete grid. Deep enough gameplay that making progress requires planning.",
    "reviewText": "Overall, a really solid 7DRL. The aspect of saving/trashing pods is really a fascinating mechanic, and hilariousness ensues if you spot a familiar name among the people in pods. The different tasks combined with the sometimes awesomely complicated architecture of levels leads to a large number of interesting scenarios during the game. \nMy only real gripe with it is that gameplaywise, it doesn't quite seem to adhere to what I perceive as design intentions. As it is, picking up pods while still exploring the level can be suicidal, especially because you apparently can't look into pods before picking them up. Nasty if you're running around with a creeped pod and the spacevent nowhere to be seen. \nBut all in all, IMO really one of the better games of this year's challenge.\n    Starship Rex is a light roguelike that has an interesting premise, but is unfortunately hampered by repetitive gameplay.  You must explore the ship, collecting stasis pods that hopefully contain live colonists.  Each colonist has a gender, an origin and an occupation, and you need a diverse set of survivors in order to win the game.  However, some stasis pods contain dead colonists that need to be recycled at the Mortisserie (whatever that is - I like to think it's a cross between a morgue and a buffet), and some contain \"creeped\" colonists (the story is very light on details) that will suck your life and eventually hatch into enemies unless you shoot them out the nearest airlock.  Unfortunately, once you understand these basic elements, there aren't really any decisions to make or surprises to uncover.  The dominant strategy seems to be:  Explore the level and find the airlock, medbay and Mortisserie, clear out all the enemies, and then take pods one by one to their respective destinations until the level is empty.  There's no real reason to go to the next level until there's nothing left in the current one, so you end up going back and forth across the level twenty-some times, which isn't much fun at all.  Maybe this could be improved by having the level slowly fall apart, so that there's some strategy in deciding what to take and what to leave behind?  In the end, I think that while Starship Rex has a good idea at its core and feels very polished, it could seriously benefit from some more work on adding depth to the gameplay.\n    Run around a spaceship delivering pods to one of three locations depending on whether they're alive, dead, or zombies. Zombies eventually break out and try to kill you. The same resource is used for combat and preservation of pods, making them gradually transform from shields to liabilities. Currently the game's unbalanced because of the gigantic maps and widely-varying distances between drop-off points. With a more consistent challenge, some more varied enemies, and perhaps an active role for rescuees, this could become an excellent coffeebreak roguelike."

Numerous back and forth seas saw battles, maybe fire your pistol off.\n    3 - Found myself furiously tapping in one-on-one sword fights, forcing my opponent back against a wall. Heart rate picked up when I was caught in the open by more than one opponent. Mad dashes for the exit if I was overwhelmed. Fun.",
    "it": "2 - I really love the idea of the breath/sword mechanic. It is an awesome twist on the typical bump-attack mechanic. What would have made this game a 3 in both innovation and fun is combine the sword mechanic with special move sequeces and tactical positioning which effects how you attack and parry. This would lead to much more interesting, and much deeper game play.\n    3 - This game is awesomely innovative in that you stick your little sword out to stab guys. I love it.\n    3 - I've never seen sword fights like this before in a RL, but I'm admittedly not a veteran player. I liked the dynamics of \"catching ones breath\" by falling back, and the extra touch of a dead enemy taking a couple of turns to stumble to the ground after being felled.",
    "st": "2 - The game was right on par with what I expect out of a 7drl.\n    2 - A bit on the low end, but this game isn't about tons of elements, it's that sword stabby and stamina gimmick that carries it.\n    2 - Solid delivery on a minimal scope. I can see a lot of room for expansion here -- better AI, varied weapons, varied enemies (rabid parrots!).",
    "rt": "3 - This game is clearly a roguelike.\n    3 - Procedural. Turn based. Some resource management if no inventory. Classic ASCII presentation. Definitely a solid example of the genre.\n    2 - It fits the bill for me.",
    "reviewText": "This game has a really nifty mechanic in the sword fighting and breath requirements. Rather than assume that the weapons are contained withint the '@' symbol, you have to wield your sword in front of you to attack. As you fight you and your opponent run out of breath, which leads to a missed parry and a stabbing through the heart. You have more breath so you can easily dispatch single opponents but fighting multiple opponents requires an interesting ebb and flow between attacking and recovering breath. There isn't a lot of replay value here, but the mechanic is definatly worth checking out.\n    This is definitely one of the stands out of this year's competition. It revolves around a very well implimented gimmick of sword fighting and stamina recharing. Positioning and rest are crucial to success, or you can just fire off your pistols. What's better your pistols seem to make a smoke screen to aid your escape. Very nice game, I recommend it to anyone and everyone.\n    The pirate theme was well-executed and appealed to me. Was hoping for more variety in weapons or combat, but I enjoyed it from start to finish and may even play some more to see how far I can get beyond the 3-treasure win condition."

Took a while to understand how to play the game. No major bugs and at least had some information in a readme file.",
    "at": "2 - I really like the style of graphics and smooth interface movements, but it lacks a bit of polish. You will find that a considerable amount of your FOV will be offscreen before the map moves, and the dark gray tetris blocks are too similar a color to the ground/construction boards to be easily distinguished. When constructing something it would be good to have a clear button, as its epsecially tedious to fail at levelling up (this has been fixed in a post 7drl version by being able to remove pieces once placed). Love the floors.\n    3 - Perfect. Great controls, mouse if you want, a wonderful and cohesive tetris motif throughout. Just awesome.\n    2 - Clever use of the tetris feel was used extensively through the game, e.g the floor tiles where tetris blocks. The game world was minimalistic but worked, however I did not like the tile graphics with ascii monsters, but I understand the 7 day time frame is a factor here.

Some good balancing ideas might be for the health potions to heal you completely, and a wider range of maneuverability spells that allow you to put some distance between you and your foe or better pick your fights.\n    2 - I really liked this game, but the more I played it became just a tad repetitive. Nearly a 3.\n    2 - The longer I played the game the more it grew on me. The combat system takes a little bit to get into, as does the crafting system, which I guess is what this game is about. A roguelike crossed between Tetris and minecraft. Crafting was interesting, once I figured out how to craft things, however most of the time I crafted with the \"cheap\" blocks I just lost my blocks with no visible gain.",

Careful planning and dancing is required to take many monsters on. Building stuff with the tetris parts you pick up is great, but can get tedious with the large boards of levelling up. The negatives of the features don't outweigh the positives enough to warrant cutting this score down. A well deserved 3.\n    3 - One of the more striking gimick games this year, took the tetris idea and just ran with it. Great.\n    3 - Yep innovative it is. A tetris/mincraft crafting system is unique in the roguelike world and it actually worked. The combat is also unique for me (though I assume it comes from a game that developer has worked on in the past). I also like the tetris inspired theme and floor tiles.",

    "rt": "3 - Absolutely.\n    3 - Perfectly roguelike. One of the few games with tons of innovation AND solidly within the genre. \n    3 - Although not as pure as some roguelikes reviewed it pretty much covers all bases.",
    "reviewText": "In the world of tetrogue, your only items are tetris peices which can be combined into shapes to buff your armor, weapon, or heal you. From the second level onward you will find elemental pieces which can be used to give your armor or weapon an elemental flavour, and with the three elements working in a rock-paper-scissors like pattern, you will have a distinct advantage over some creatures and disadvantage over others. So much so that if an enemy has a fire armor and you have a plain or nature weapon you cannot kill that enemy with bump attacks unless you have a really high attack. Early game this is rarely the case. Two of the classes have abilities that can help here, but they can only be used a limited number of times before resting to recharge, meaning that under duress you will likely be overcome. Its incredibly hard because you will often come into the situation where there is nothing you can do or could have done to save yourself when the enemy you are against is effectively indestructible, or can simply deal more damage or restore more armor over time than you can. With balance though this is definately a game to watch for the future.\n    This is one of the most striking games of the competition. Totally innovative and fun. If I were to recommend 5 games from this competition this would be one of them. The tetris idea of interlocking pieces is taken to the illogical extreme, and it totally works. Walk around, fight, collect pieces, build stuff to power up your character. Just great man, I cannot recommend it enough. There's a post 7DRL release as well, so check that out.\n    An unique blend of tetris and minecraft crafting systems squashed into the body of a roguelike. You start the game as one of three characters each with their own stats and skills. You wander around the dungeon searching for enemies and tertis (crafting) peices, enemies drop crafting peices as well. Once you have enough of a set you can craft better armour, weapons, health or energy. You use energy for your skills, therefore energy is in limited supply so skills are better saved until really needed. There is also a rock/paper/scissors mechanic of \"elemental' attack/defence that I really did not fully explore but seemed an extra element to give the game more depth. Not a bad effort by any means, I believe the devloper made good use of previous code but which needed to be hidden a bit to give this game a finished feel; undocumented keys were in abundance. These things considered and better help would could make this a real gem."

ASCII color scheme well put together and fits the mood, though not all monsters in the tower did (kittens?!) Font generally fit the mood, but is hard on the eyes after a while.\n    2 - A little BROWN for my tastes but the way the graphics are painted -- especially when the view rotates around is very cool.

It gets way more interesting later, but the early game doesn't do it many favors. \n    2 - Rotational field of view is a very cool way to explore a dungeon. The dungeons seemed a little sparse to me though, especially in the early game. And I hate smashing into entry level monsters multiple times. I know the character only starts with a club but just let me kill goblins really easily please! When you go toe to toe with the first monster you see and it lasts 6 or 7 rounds it doesn't quite make you feel very heroic! I found exploration much more fun than the combat. Was also sometimes difficult to tell how much health i had and which the better set of equipment was.\n    2 - I was originally a bit put off by how basic it seemed, with difficulty spikes that sort of ruined the fun. Then I realized you can rotate, that facing mattered. Very cool. Very fun. Confusing, but I've never had so much fun getting totally turned around in a dungeon/tower before. If not for the difficulty spikes unbalancing the game this would be a solid 3.",

So much so that I didn't even notice at first -- of course that's what the game should do!

    "reviewText": "A fascinating, atmospheric take with some neat ideas on field of view and combat. There's a lot of potential here if the bugs are worked out. Plus, the music's great.\n    A great-looking solid 7DRL. In Tower of Despair you are limited to seeing only what is in front of you, which makes for some confusing navigation at first (the screen will rotate around you, and you can \"strafe-step\" ala most First Person Shooters) but some fun exploration and great atmosphere once you get used to it. Menus are a bit clunky and there wasn't a HUD that I could figure out.. had to sort of guess how good equipment was. Great music that really sets the tone for the game... very tower-y.\n      This is a very solid entry for 2013. It looks good, plays good, the music changes with the situation. The design choice to not display your health or the affect of equiping items is questionable. I often wanted to know what my best gear load out would be, and how much health I had. I respect the choice but I think it reduced my ability to make informed decisions. Having the screen darken as you became injured helped quite a bit, as did the music cues. I had an issue with frustrating difficulty spikes, but as you get better at the game you learn how to mitigate the seemingly cheap deaths. This is my highest rated game thus far.  LATER: I've come back to this game to see if I had perhaps overrated it, that's when I realized all the items, enemies and keybinds can be altered, expanded and enhanced by anyone with a text editor and even the most basic understanding of code...that's awesome. My high marks stand."

It is very unclear where you can move because you can move under the tops of the trees.  When sight is so important, it is important the rules of sight for the player match those of the top down - shifting the trees to that perspective makes two conflicting rules.\n    3 - A fully graphical tileset makes this very accessable, and it's always pretty clear what's going on.  There isn't a huge variety in tile types, but what there is feels consistent.\n    3 - No problems. However, IMO it makes no sense to have player's facing direction if we can change this direction immediately at no cost. It would be better to let the player look in all directions.",
    "ft": "2 - A nice stealth game - it was fun sneaking up to the robots.  It is well done in that the robots aren't too smart either.\n    2 - The unique mechanic makes learning to play this interesting in itself, and the high difficulty and good variety of inventory items you can get keeps me coming back, despite the fairly samey combat and lack of variety in enemies.\n    3 - I would like to play it more... so 3 is deserved.",
    "it": "3 - Pure stealth roguelikes are always good.  This follows most of the standard tropes, but must gain credit for following them well.  The graphics are used well to add facing to the enemies in addition to their LOS to help you judge their turning directions.  Overlays when they alert also help a lot.\n    3 - Doesn't play like any other roguelike at all, and the mechanic is enjoyable rather than just gimmicky.\n    2 - I think this stealth-grid-turn-based game has been done in an innovative way. A strong 2.",
    "st": "2 - A very nice set of things made it into this game!  Lots of interesting items, contributing to the stealth gameplay. make for a lot of variety from game to game.\n    2 - Not massively ambitious - the map consists of randomly placed trees on a snowy landscape, and there aren't very many enemies - but most of the attention has been paid to polishing the features that are present, so this can be forgiven in a 7DRL.\n    2 - Several types of enemies, weapons, and other items.",
    "rt": "3 - With the random equipment pickups, the random maps, and the single-mode of gameplay, this easily is a roguelike.\n    1 - Aside from the fact it's top-down and turnbased, it's quite far from a traditional roguelike.  Movement is handled in an unusual way - you rotate your player, and walk forwards (or backwards).  There's no maze or levels to descend as such - you just have to get a certain distance from the start in a landscape of random trees.\n    3 - I think it is roguelike enough for a 3.",
    "reviewText": "In ColdRL you must battle against both heat and blood loss as you try to escape.  Winning is a mere matter of travelling 600 meteres outwards from your start, but you won't make it without taking out a few of these robots first.  And they *will* take you out in a fair fight. So I guess you aren't going to be fighting fairly then, are you?  ColdRL does a nice implementation of a stealth roguelike to make for some interesting gameplay.\n    A game focusing on stealth and planning - you move and turn independently, and have a limited field of view, as do the enemies.  Arrows give you hints about what they're about to do.  Your goal is to get a certain distance from the start, in any direction, but this becomes increasingly difficult.  You cannot easily survive a conflict with more than one enemy at once, and you must pick your battles carefully - however, you can't just avoid all the enemies either, because you need the heat packs some of them carry in order to survive long enough to make the goal.  The cold mechanic is obviously there just to put this pressure on you to fight or flee, but it's a formula that works, giving you a sense of urgency.  The game is hard, and you're forced to develop a strategy, which makes it surprisingly replayable for such a simple concept, without feeling like you're having to grind your way through.  However, you often find yourself in combat situations you simply cannot win, or are killed by enemies you didn't even see - running away is not an option, as most enemies seem able to keep up with you and shoot - so trying to play for an extended time can end up quite frustrating.\n    A roguelike with an innovative stealth system. Your purpose is to escape from some robots hunting you. You can escape in any direction you want. You can use weapons, and some helpful items. I have escaped roughly 300 of 600 meters, and I think I will be playing more."

    "at": "3 - While simple, the sprites were very nice looking and fit perfectly with the theme.\n    2 - Tile graphics are simple but effective. Also of note is the writing: lots of descriptive passages chiseled into rocks and in the description of books add flavour to the game.\n    2 - Functional graphics, no sound, the typing mechanism works well, but the hotkey dance near the end strains the UI",
    "ft": "3 - Overall the game is great. I could see some folks being bored by the puzzles, but for me personally it was a lot of fun (thus the 3). My one complaint was in the portculius area. By the last puzzle in this area I was sick of them.\n    2 - Quite a fun game: I enjoyed solving the puzzles and discovering the magic spell words. Some of the mazes / retracing steps got a bit tedious after a while though\n    2 - Overall a very weel made game, but a bit too long, both in some puzzles and in the number of puzzles. More than one spinner puzzle, two teleport puzzles, more mazes than I could shake a stick at. Each was fun by itself, but overall too much.",
    "it": "3 - Procedurally generated puzzles are not standard roguelike material. \n    2 - I liked the magic spells - a nice mechanic if you're a purist and don't mind writing a few notes down during a game. Importantly, you can bind spell phrases to function keys to avoid typing them out every time!\n    2 - An interesting puzzle mechanic, like taking all the puzzle in a full length RL and stuffing them in a gauntlet. Use of yelling spells is also interesting, while as old as RPGs themselves, I haven't seen the mechanic lately.",
    "st": "2 - The game scope was on par with what I would expect from a 7DRL\n    2 - A pretty decent scope for a 7DRL.

More than your average 7DRL.",
    "rt": "2 - Lack of inventory, combat, death, etc makes this less of a roguelike, but the game is definatly roguelike inspired. I would love to see elements from this game put into other roguelikes.\n    2 - Mostly roguelike, though feels a bit more like a puzzle solving game. No hitpoints, stats, items or permadeath (though lack of permadeath is probably a good choice in this game - it's easy to make a mistake and die!)\n    2 - More of a puzzler than a roguelike, felt like a throwback to the Adventures of Lolo and Chip at times. Puzzles have PG elements to them and I think the overall layout of puzzles is PG as well, so enough for a 2 at least.",
    "reviewText": "The game consists of a series of intra-related puzzles. After solving each puzzle you learn rune words which allow you to teleport to other puzzles, and learn spells which help solve some of those puzzles. The puzzles are procedurally generated using your name, so each time you play under the same name, the world is the same. The effect is that you need to get out paper and pencil (or a textfile and vim in my case) and write down the rune words as you discover them. Most of the puzzles are pretty fun to solve, and overall the game is really fun. My biggest complaint is that the nature of the puzzles makes this game less replayable than some. Still, of all the 7DRLs I've played, this is one of the better ones.\n    This is a good little game: halfway between a puzzle game and a roguelike with some nice descriptive touches. The key gameplay feature is learning the words to different spells in order to solve a variety of different challenges and gain access to different areas.\n    Malachite Dreams is a hybrid Roguelike/Puzzle game where you solve a series of 2-5 minute puzzles to learn spells to unlock more puzzles in an enough to solve a riddle. The puzzles are fun and finding tricks to solve them is engaging, but there are more puzzles than content and the makes the game drag towards the end. It's a bit long for a coffee break, probably close to an hour in length, but if you like positional puzzlers, it is worth a try. Also, try to guess the final riddle early, it is worth the effort."

Borrows a mechanic from Go. Both very rare or unseen in roguelikes.",

    "rt": "2 - It is semi-roguelike. It involves turn based tactics, works off a grid and the enemies are letters. No items, character advancement etc.\n    2 - I wouldn't call it a roguelike but there are definitely roguelike elements. Turn based, procedural enemies. Not any real item/resource management sub-systems though.\n    3 - Procedural maps generated by player, permanent death. Selection of enemies seems more random than procedural.",
    "reviewText": "It's fun to play - I particularly loved the way that the sound is genetated by the map. As a game I felt it was a bit lacking in depth and variety but it makes up for that with all the pretty colours and noises  - congrats to the author for making a colourful musical toy in Roguelike style! \n    This game sounds great. The dynamic music generated sounds like something straight out of a film score. While attempting to fill the entire screen with a beautifully colored mosaic, you are thwarted by enemies. You can box these enemies in qix-style to destroy them, which makes for some tactical, if somewhat frantic, gameplay. Visually it looks amazing and I keep leaving the music on in the background. Definitely not a hardcore roguelike, but definitely worth a play.\n    So far this is the 2013 7DRL that I've spent most time on, because it's a fun pretty roguelike with totally new mechanics. It's currently marred by imbalance, bugs which artificially increase the difficulty, and monotonous music. Strategy for most levels is the same - keep going around the edge of the map until the enemies forget to make a hole in the circle you're tracing. Once a critical mass of enemies is reached, all other strategies become ineffective. With the bugs fixed and other strategies made more practical, this would easily become a regular play."

Controls are explained in detail, but are a bit needlessly convoluted.  Your health is not displayed anywhere on-screen and having to switch to another status screen just to check it is annoying (though this does appear to have already been fixed in the post-7DRL version).\n    3 - The controls were sensible, nothing too complicated. As for the game's appearance, this what I would expect from a roguelike game.",
    "ft": "2 - Pretty fun, what with the firearm system and all. The only problem is since the levels are non-euclidean and it's impossible to clear rooms, you don't really get a sense of progress, more just wander around shooting things until you win or die. Exploration is sort of pointless.\n    1 - Pretty boring, really - largely because of the zelda-esque room-based level layout.  Typically gameplay consists of simply standing in the doorway of the room shooting everything that comes towards you.  When they're dead, pick an exit at random and then rinse and repeat until you either run out of ammo, are one-shotted by something lurking the other side of a doorway or win.  There seem to not be much else in the way of valid tactics - since enemies respawn the second you step out of the room even retreating is usually not beneficial.  While it initially seems to promise some compelling lovecraftian atmosphere this is completely undermined by the gameplay mechanics.\n    2 - The is nice to play, but the difficulty of surviving long enough to use the other features of the game is a little disappointing. Ramping up of the skill level more slowly, would have made this non-Euclidean romp that much more enjoyable.",
    "it": "1 - It's well-executed but fundamentally there's nothing but wandering around killing things.\n    1 - Nothing that Infra Arcana hasn't already done much better, with the possible minor exception of the 'non-euclidian' (i.e. overlapping) level geometry.\n    2 - I'm sure non-Euclidean geometry has been tried before, but for the games I've reviewed this year, that is certainly novel. I would have enjoyed exploring this landscape further, but I never managed to survive long enough to visit three or four rooms.",

Spherical geometry is non-Euclidean and while it certainly would be different, I don't think many people would think that to be too challenging for a 7 day roguelike.",
    "rt": "3 - Yeah, definitely an RL.\n    3 - Yep.\n    3 - Very much roguelike",
    "reviewText": "This was pretty fun. You go through a randomly-generated maze, fighting Lovecraftian horrors. It doesn't feel very themed (you could rename the monsters to be orcs and it would play about the same) but it's not bad. A lot of the combat uses firearms, which have to be reloaded and have ranges, etc, which works pretty well. It's cool to be blasting away at something slowly shambling toward you.\n    This is an interesting and good-looking roguelike inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, however unfortunately only in the same way that a lot of other roguelikes are 'inspired' by Tolkien - i.e. it takes place and enemy names from the Cthulu Mythos, but not a lot else.  There is not really any sense of horror built up and gunning down wave after wave of Mi-gos and Yithians is hardly setting-appropriate.  The non-euclidian levels are a feature that sounds good on paper but ends up hamstringing the gameplay since it makes any form of forward planning or positional tactics fairly moot - a more traditional dungeon layout would have resulted in a much better game and would have allowed the otherwise fairly solid mechanics to shine.\n    I had pretty high hopes for this game, it certainly had the classic roguelike graphics and controls. However I was never able to get into the game because of the frustrating level of difficulty, I typically managed to visit three or four rooms before I was dead. That made the usage of non-Euclidean geometry pointless, since I never visited enough of the map to observe its effects. The lack of healing items made progressing a very rapid war of attrition, and with all the creatures moving every turn, you are not able to out run or out maneuver them. This could be an interesting game, the author just needs to ramp up the level of difficulty a little more slowly, and possible have a few health items laying around or dropped by creatures."

However it's not all that compelling on replays - once you've mastered it the game has little to come back for.\n    2 - A fun little game, the goal being to avoid the mice that are chasing you and make it to the exit. The game can be quite challenging given the small size of each level and the number of assailants chasing after you.\n    3 - While what is fun and what isn't can be according to taste, for me this is a highly recommended game for its fun factor.

Only 4 levels and 2 baddies, but the levels are well designed and procedural, the difficulty ramps up well and the behavior is challenging.

Some sort of inventory or resource managment would have gotten this game a 3, with a bullet.",
    "reviewText": "Nya Quest put you in control of a cute cat battling vile mice on a holy quest to attain a ball of yarn. The real core of this game is how you can manipulate the facing of enemies to land a hit without receiving any hits back. It means a lot of movement about in battle, keeping a close eye on enemy position and facing, trying to manipulate things turn by turn. It's a small but polished game, and it explores this facing mechanic very well.\n    The game looks cute with the hand drawn main character icon, and the levels while relatively small do provide a challenge, especially with the presence of several assailants chasing the main character. The addition of two varities of assailants with their differing AI, adds to the challenge the game offers. Certainly worth playing several times.\n    For some this game might be a bit too simple or short. But in the context of the 7DRL this is one of the standouts. A nicely tuned little strategy game with a cutsey cat and some dastardly mice. If you want a quick fix and some minor brain burns, this is the one for you."

Overall, a very solid game, with very good visuals.\n    Rogue's Eye is a roguelike presented like a Dungeon Master title. You crawl the procedurally generated dungeon, find loot and exterminate monsters as normal, but from a 1st person perspective. The graphics are a solid blend from somewhere betweeh the 8-bit and 16-bit eras, with a dash of prerendered polygons. Gameplay is quick and straightforward, smash head on monsters to kill them, and you only improve via potions on your quest down to the 7th level of the dungueon. Definitely worth a try if you miss the days of Eye of the Beholder.\n    Solid Grimrock Mountain-esque dungeon crawl.  No fancy features but everything is well-implemented and attractive, an all-round polished game."

The 2nd level had no exit I could find on my first run, so I had to restart, none of the shards even blocked movement but it seemed like they should. I was able to move right through them. My character easily walked straight off of the map and into nothingness, don't go too far off the map it seems to lock the game up. I'd give this a 1 except that I'm not sure what the author was going for here. If a neat audio and visual experience was the goal then I guess the errors I found were not too significant. \n    3 - Ran fine, looks and sounds very polished.

    "ft": "2 -  I found it hard to really get into because I often had no idea whether I was retracing the same steps, especially once you get abilities to move the terrain it becomes a nightmare of navigation and confusion. That said, this game is definately worth a try.\n    1 - It seemed like there was absolutely nothing to do but wander around. No dangers, nothing to overcome, just pretty pictures and sound. That's neat and all but it's hard to describe it as fun. In one run I ended up just moving in a grid pattern looking for an exit.\n    2 - It was enjoyable more as an audio/visual experience then as a game experience. Very casual toylike feel to it",

    "rt": "1 - Nope. The level layouts are procedurally generated but simplistic, and one or two levels down they become totally malleable.\n    2 - I'll disagree with the other reviewers that this is not a very roguelike game. It has that sense of exploration, it has procedural content, inventory to find and use, it's real time but hardly twitch based. It's top down sort of dungeon crawl. It certainly lacks some of the more classic elements, but there's enough here that I can see the influence of the roguelike genre. \n    1 - Great game but really does not feel anything at all like a roguelike",
    "reviewText": "Float around in a sea of triangles and chiming noise. Occasionally peaceful, occasionally frustrating, and often confusing - but there is little that can hurt you. If you dont mind just meandering around looking at the shapes and listening to the sweet cacophony as you search for the black hole to the next area then an overall enjoyable experience.\n    This is a beautiful looking experience for your eyes and ears. There doesn't seem to be a ton in the way of gameplay, but you can explore around and see all the nifty shards of glass. Very much a cool toy.\n    The game feels a little out of place here as its very polished and enjoyable but really has nothing to do with roguelikes. The combination of graphics and mellow audio effects make it an enjoyable experience to play with though."

Some Geth have an exploding attack which can one-shot you even when you're at full health. That's no fun.\n    2 - Lots to do here, especially with custom character creation, and the game is fairly difficult.

The different levels of cover are a really great element. \n    1 - There are \"low barriers\", over which you can jump in one move, or instakill weak enemies if they happen to be on the other side. I think that this is an original idea which could be developed further, but it is not very developed in this game. Other than that, I see no innovation, so I give only 1.",

Sound and graphics are done very well, adding to the overall slick look and atmosphere of the game.\n    Definitely a game focused mostly on aesthetics, but those aesthetics are beautiful and somewhat innovative (I'd love to see that font used in more ASCII roguelikes). Some ideas could use clearing up, but that could be my lack of knowledge about Mass Effect showing. Still worth a download, though, if only to admire its character creation and its polish.\n    I have been playing version 1.1. I sometimes win the first wave, but it seems to depend mostly on the AI's decisions (whether the boss has decided to attack me or not), and I do not see any strategy which could be more successful. In the second wave, I run out of ammo, and I see no way around this. On the good side, this game has very nice ASCII-like graphics, sounds, and theme. I think it could evolve into a very good game."

Vi key support, very smooth game play with the controls being pretty much just arrows and space.\n    3 - Presented in the ASCII style of Rogue but with a fantastic user interface. There are only a couple of buttons you need to play the game, with arrows and space bar doing almost everything. For ease of play and clarity of display this game has perfect Aesthetics. I urge other developers to follow this example. The updated version of this game is even playable via mouse.\n    2 - Nice work with color and light. Basic ASCII view otherwise",

There were some balance issues off and on, but there's no doubt this game is just fun fun fun. Getting to pick abilties each level instead of grinding xp for new abilities is a great 'fun' game play choice. Being able to chat up other players is also pretty cool. \n    1 - Balance is way off, was not challeged by anything in the first 10 levels.",
    "it": "3 - So, we've all seen in-browser games.  And we've seen movement based attacks.  And the monster abillities are cloned from Nethack.  But what this does better than most games, and better than many games that *try* to do this, is have a game where you start strong and get weaker as you progress.  Any powerful weapon you find soon breaks itself, leaving you scrounging for daggers (whose 1d6 base makes them best in ruined state)  Your strength just is constantly sapped.  Your max hp can only go down.  And the monsters?  They only get more powerful.  This contradicts my desire for a tighter start game - I suggest that based on what would be more fun, but the very lax start game really hammers home the end games feeling of hitting the end of your rope.\n    1 - This game is not about innovation, not at all, but that is not a slam on the game. There are some interesting mechanics, but really this is an homage to roguelikes in the classic style but with an updated interface.\n    2 - Nice work with getting the UI and inventory to work with a minimal set of keys. Pretty standard fare otherwise.",

Enough to keep you interested for a few hours.\n    2 - Standard 7DRL",

Procedural and Permadeath, plus all of the ancillary qualities like fantasy theme, dungeon diving, bump interaction, inventory management and also resource management in regards to weapon durability.\n    3 - Definitely a roguelike.",
    "reviewText": "Most roguelikes are teenage power fantasies.  You start as the weak and vulnerabel noob.  You train and practice and become a death dealing god that steamrolls the world.   Rodney does not look any different on the surface - it has the all the standard mechanics that signal to you that this is the path you will take.  But you don't.  As you go deeper, your weapons break, and your max hp drops, and your strength wanes.  You swiftly yearn to be the carefree noob again, rather than forced to fight a regenerating troll with a ruined dagger.\n    This is the best example of a straight Roguelike in the competition. An homage to the classic ASCII dungeon dives we all love so much. On first release there were some bugs but they seem to have been ironed out since. Even the name is a send up of The Amulet of Yendor, the original McGuffin in Rogue. If you have played Rogue or Brogue you know exactly what you are getting into here, but this one plays quicker due to its interface. I recommend playing this one for all people who have ever enjoyed a roguelike, there's absolutely zero learning curve and only 1 button to remember. Space bar. Hit it when you want to do something. That's basically the only directions you need. Just jump right in and give it a go!\n    Standard dungeon crawl, apparently melee only, with positional combat maneuvers you learn at level up. There aren't many options for combat though, and actual gameplay seems to lack balance. Was able to plow through the first 10 levels without having to care at all about my HP. Game froze when trying to go to level 11. Liked the minimalist approach to interface with just the single action button. Could have gone further with that and autodrop useless items like spent torches."

Choice of keys is rather nonstandard. 'p' for pick and 'o' for drop. With non-repeating keys you have to tap your keyboard a lot.\n    3 - Nice, clear use of ASCII characters - particularly the use of tilds as seaweed.

Exploration vs o2 level choice is non-trivial. But combat is pretty dull.\n    2 - I really liked the game concept and story.

The exploration side was fun, but the fact the goal (getting the treasure) was next to impossible, was quite disappointing.",
    "it": "2 - A very worthy attempt at a 3d roguelike.  The big problem is that you are tantalizing close to being able to use the 3d dimension for working around the map, but if you dive where there is no valid target, you just dive randomly.  If instead you could only dive or rise into an empty square, and there were two side-screens given your local 5x5 above and below topography, the game might blow open this genre.\n    2 - Oxygen level as hp is interesting mechanics.

Thankfully, there are bubbles of air you can recover some breath from.  Remember, however, that technically you have to get back with your loot!\n    This is the kind of a game which is difficult at first, but the more you play it, the more you figure tings out, the easier the game become. Which is probably nice. You have to dive to the sea floor to pick up some golden doubloons. There are five doubloons and five items slots.You need to make a choice - what items to abandon. Greed might kill you on the way to the surface. It's a really worth to try this once. Killing sea creatures to gain exp and level up seems a little out of place.\n    Aside from the bugs and the slightly too high-powered enemies, this is a nice concept and quite well excecuted. The look and feel is really good for what it is conveying, and the controls and interface are solid and well done."

And obviously the game lacks in complexity. Your options are limited by moving around and changing facing. No items, no abilities. Bluntly speaking if my life will depend on blinking, I'll use my fingers to keep my eyes open.\n    Wow, what a fun game. It feels like watching the Dr. Who episodes it's based on, very creepy and sort of frantic. You should definitely try this one out.\n    Don't Blink! Weeping Angel statues stalk you through a mausoleum. As long as you keep looking at them, they won't move. This game essentially features one mechanic -- line of sight -- and executes on it very very well. You can 'g'lance and 's'tare in order to keep statues in sight.

Also, there's a blurry fog of war effect on tiles outside your sight, but you can still see enemies moving around on those tiles (not sure if this is intentional.)\n    2 - Quite polished, but there are some problems. The player character can move and attack diagonally, and enemies cannot, which allows one to fight the melee enemies without any harm, in some circumstances. I suppose this is not intentional. Also some enemies use ranged attacks like energy blasts and magical spells, the player can find blasters and wands, but it seems that it is impossible to fire them (they seem to be just powerful melee weapons).

The music and sound effects are nice and don't get annoying.  I particularly liked the wand sound effect, which randomized a bit every time and made attacking feel quite satisfying.  The menus aren't perfect (you have to scroll through a pretty small inventory window which fills up quickly) but they got the job done.

What sets it apart is the setting and the graphics.  There aren't any mechanics besides hack-and-slashing enemies and occasionally using a scroll (comic book).  There isn't any leveling either - the only progression is going to new levels and occasionally getting new equipment.  Doesn't stay entertaining for long, although the new enemies and new tilesets as you descend help to keep things from getting dull too quickly.\n    2 - Mostly \"bump to attack\", so not very chalenging or replayable (you can also cast spells from the \"comic books\", but I think you could win without doing that).

    "reviewText": "This is a nicely-done graphical roguelike with a novel and humorous thematic twist and a huge amount of content.  However a lot more effort seems to have been expended on cosmetic aspects rather than gameplay ones, which leaves the game itself a little lacking in variety and tactical depth.\n    A fairly standard roguelike with a bizarre premise - you're at a cosplay convention and everybody has suddenly gone crazy.  The theme carries throughout the game - energy drinks replenish your health, comic books let you cast spells, and your equipment items are all costume props.  Most of the development seems to have gone into the graphics and sound, and it definitely shows.  The characters animate as they move around and attack, and as you descend through the levels you encounter new enemies and new tilesets.  If I could change one thing about the game, it would be to make it shorter - each \"area\" of the dungeon is two levels deep, and I felt like they could have easily been 1 level deep instead.  At its current length, the game areas get dull fairly quickly.  Although it doesn't try anything new gameplay-wise, Cosplay Mystery Dungeon is a nice example of how polished a 7DRL can look and feel.\n    A beautifully animated roguelike with a cosplay theme. I have won, and I think it is very nice to play, but it lacks challenge and replayability."

Good use of hex and coloring. Good use of control characters. I found it very immersive and easy to use. Some may grade this title down a bit for the use of YUHLBN key controls, but after just a bit you get used to them. Also the controls are constantly displayed so you can refer to them when needed.

You won't get tremendous fun with it, but it's still worth a quick try.\n    Very much a quick, casual roguelike. Very enjoyable for what it is, and the premise is amusing. The visuals are lovely. I finished it on my first go, but I'd be more than happy to play it again.\n     Some games just have a theme that make you giggle, and this is one of them. You play a sperm going for the egg. So you are running up the birth canal dodging ganglia and fighting diseases like chlamydia and such. You can see your little dead sperm buddies littering the sides of the 'cavern'. Just a ton of fun. I was tempted to grade this title down because of the lack of difficulty, but I was able to sustain my interests by instituting personal challenges. I was able to get the egg with 482 energy left. My high score. Beat that!"

But at some point you realize that doing awesome, from the game point of view, things is stupidly simple. This breaks the fun, to some extent. It's still worthwhile effort, an experiment that has it's definite result.\n    This game shows that roguelikes and explosions do mix. Very good integration of weapons and explosives. Would like more interesting enemies to explode"

It is very smooth with only one bug I could find, but it was a doozy. You could get stuck between 2 guys and not move, causing you to need to reset. It's no biggie if it happens only once in awhile, but it happened so much I had to create a gameplay strategy to get around it. I don't think creating a gameplay strategy around needing to reset is so good. \n    3 - In one game I got stuck without faith between a follower and a non-follower, and the only solution was restart.

The walls light up a similar color to the hallways so it's a bit awkward to tell where the hallways are at a glance.\n    2 - I liked the look and control of this game, it gave nice feedback. It used Oryx graphics, which I am a big fan off. The only issue was these strange one off pixels, or lines of color, surrounding some of the tiles. You earn big points for clarity, but those pixels were clear and destracting. But for that I'd give it a 3, I really would. \n    2 - I really like the player character design. However, there are some bad things: there are small glitches on my machine (some odd pixels above the character images), and healthbars are sometimes invisible due to being obscured by another monster.",

The idea of only being able to convert monsters which then fight for you is worth exploring, but it's not very well balanced making it easy to get stuck.\n    2 - I really enjoyed the concept here but there just wasn't enough depth for a 3.

It's fun to convert the enemies and then move around so that your buddies attack the other ones.\n    Another impressive entry in the 7DRL this year, Faith In RL should definitely be given a go. There are some wonky issues where you character can get cornered, and some of the sprites have little artifacts, but those are minor quibbles. This is an above average game, has nice graphics by Oryx, is playable with mouse and has a very minimal interface. Meaning no keys to memorize or reference sheet to constantly consult. Very cool. It has sound and atmospheric music to keep your interested. Best of all it is based around a single gameplay feature, I love that in a 7DRL. Here that feature is the ability to convert baddies into your disciples. \n    In this game, where you cannot attack your enemies, you can only convert them using your \"faith\" resource. After the conversion they will fight for you. There are only a few types of enemies, and they are very similar, but the game is very fun to play. I want to win, I have to play a bit more..."

The \"stand in the corner\" strategy is so overpowered that I never needed to do anything else though.\n    2 - you're back to the real heart of a roguelike stripped down to its simplest form. Every turn must be carefully planed, one mistake and you're screwed. On another hand, if you get bad luck at map generation and can't reach a safe place before starting the fight, you're dead.

Lots of things to kill with your awesome combat stats.\n    2 - as far as I know, taking your surroundings into account in the defense points computation is quite new. Each weapon also updates its attack stats depending on your attack moves. This gives a nice, complex combat system despite using only 2 integer variables (defense, attack).\n    2 - It's nice that the characters show what items they're using and that the enemies can pick up items.",

Shields, potions, and weapons can help but if you step in the wrong place, you'll quickly be outflanked and killed. Super simple to play with a strong focus on tactics. A level can be way too easy if you start near a dead end though. Good thing each level is small. There appears to be special moves with each weapon, but I never noticed much of a difference.\n    A chess-like, hardcore little game where every mistake costs a lot. Also needs some investment because you have to figure out the rules by yourself. The force of the game is to bring a great deal of tactical complexity with a minimalist set of rules. A must-try.\n    Runs in a browser so it's easy to play. The images were a bit small on my monitor and it can be a little hard to see what's going on with your stats until you get used to it. The help file and story are nice. There's a lot of potential strategy built in, but the optimal strategy doesn't require any thought about what you're wielding. Because items wear out I never died once I figured out that strategy but did end up in a position where I wasn't doing or taking damage, which is when I self-declared game over and restarted."

Some levels are instand death traps, e.g. multiple snakes spawning next to you, etc.  \n    3 - Seemed to be complete, no bugs I could find.

The \"living\" dungeon did not really work for me, it was really too chaotic. The inventory almost looks tacked on.\n    2 - Nice little tiles. I could tell exactly what was what despite them being a bit small. The controls and display were not quite as nice, but they were servicable.",
    "ft": "3 - Definitely fun. In addition to ascending with the amulet, it's fun to just watch the levels do what they do.\n    2 - The game was a little too random to make it playable.  Snakes spawn next to level entrances, fires can engulf entire levels. Not having a wait command or diagonal movement detracted from the game. I had to wait many, many turns waiting for a worm to dig a straight tunnel to the exit.\n    2 - This is a very fun little game, the only issue was in the coral level where I would sometimes have to wait hundreds of turns before the worms dug out a path to the exit. Also you could sometimes start very close to a snake, making the game pretty short. I tried to fight the snakes with various thrown items, but it didn't seem to pan out. So I just ran and avoided them, this didn't always work. Was hoping for a way to defeat the snakes without taking so much damage. Perhaps I just i didn't discover it.",

Each levels was different, with different strategy; both in gameplay and level evolution. Loved the worms and their segmented bodies digging out the dungeon for me.\\\n    3 - This game was very innovative in that it created 4 very unique environments. The levels themselves changed, grew and morphed according to lifelike rules. The worms each the grass, which grows on the stone, the stone comes from the coral, which grows from ground. Very nice.",
    "st": "2 - There are several different levels, each with its own play style.\n    2 - Seems quite simple on the surface, but as you watch how the dungeon levels evolves around you, you can see where the effort was put in. Probably on par for a 7drl.\n    2 - Kind of a short game. Not a ton of elements, but enough for a solid small game.",
    "rt": "3 - Sure.\n    2 - Lacks exploration, more of a turn-based strategy game. Still some roguelike elements.\n    3 - Permadeath, procedural content, turn based play. Yep, it's roguelike alright.",
    "reviewText": "This game has a different little ecosystem on each level. You can interact or interfere, or try to sneak past threats when the conditions are right. It might be nice to see the items given a stronger presence, as you can often ignore them entirely right now. Recommended.\n    Trapped inside a giant game of Life; the dungeon literally evolves around you, with each level having its own ecosystem. However the gameplay itself feels like it is playing second fiddle to theevolving world surrounding the character. Perhaps the game would be better as a peice of living art rather than a roguelike. That said the gameplay is quite simple but difficult to win. Luck and world generation play a large role in success. I could not find a way to wait a turn or move diagonally which really detracted from the gameplay. This made some levels nearly impossible and frustrating. What the developer has done is really quite impressive though.    \n    This was a fun little game. At first it can be unclear about what's going on with all of the snails and snakes and what not, but after a few plays you realize that each level is alive. Just moving back and forth and watching the level develop can be pretty cool. I didn't quite beat the game, though I did get right next to the amulet. Watch out for the snakes!"

The hallucination effect is pretty awesome.\n    3 - Not many people went for the sprites in this competition, it was a good choice however, I don't see how changing it to ASCII would make it any more roguelike. The HUD is very good too, lets you know what you need to know pretty much instantly.",

Has no replay value though, there are no differing play styles, you really just have to keep your concentration up - dont step into a blind corner, otherwise it is a basic puzzle game.\n    1 - The elemental damage model is interesting, but because you can only hold one spell at a time it really just means a lot of irritating running backwards and forwards.  The game tells you what enemy each element beats, so there is not even any puzzle mechanic of having to figure that out for yourself.  The enemies don't move so there is no real danger provided you are paying attention.\n    3 - I enjoyed it! It was hard, and challenging, and I admit I got frustrated very easily, but it really was fun collecting the pages. The hidden puzzle of getting the right essence to kill the right monster contributed heavily to that and the worry of keeping yourself hopeful kept you on your toes.",

An extra point for animation and the ever-changing landscape.\n    1 - While its rare for a game to treat it quite this strictly, there is nothing new about an elemental damage system.  Enemies that don't move is also quite unusual, but I can't really call it an *innovation*.\n    2 - Very different, but enjoyable. Kept the roguelike theme but made it into a collecting game.",

Simple.\n    2 - Pretty big, with a variety of different zones, enemies and status effects, however as the enemies are static and the spells have no difference beyond the enemy they kill this largely just amounts to graphic-swapping.  There are different difficulty settings, although from what I've played it doesn't seem to make much difference.\n    2 - Randomly generated levels, including differently themed ones is very impressive.",
    "rt": "1 - Not trying to be a roguelike.  Obviously based on a roguelike, but not a roguelike. Procedually generated content maps is about it. Ok a small fraction of the ememies actually move, but not really enough for a roguelike.\n    3 - Pretty much a roguelike, although it lacks the tactical challenge of one.\n    2 - A roguelike, but different. More of a puzzle/Scavenger hunt type game than a roguelike.",
    "reviewText": "Another strategy based game, where most ememies do not move. You are a wizard on a quest to find 88 pages FTW. The landscape is maze-like, littered with unmoving elemental nasties that attack if you get close. If you have the right elemental defence or attack you can move past or defeat them. Due to the ever-changing landscape hard to get pages can be left behind, eleminating the need for any stragegy. Slow down and take you time and you will always get close if not win. Graphics-wise this game is good, but the strategy elements need to be better for this game to be fun and challenging.\n    A very nice-looking game which has a range of interesting ideas, but they sadly fail to resolve into gameplay of any depth.  The game ultimately becomes a fairly uninteresting fetch quest, both in collecting the titular pages and in having to run backwards and forwards to change spell.  Just exploring the world is actually fairly interesting, and I think that the game could potentially be quite fun if only the enemies could move (and thereby pose a threat) and if the elemental damage system were made a bit more nuanced.\n    88 Pages was the most complete of all the games I have reviewed. It is beautifully well designed and an extremely enjoyable experience that was a challenge to play. My only real problem with it was that the instructions, while straight forward, did not go into detail about certain things like how you could lose from depression as well as from being killed. The new elemental types in the differnent areas was nice, it mixed things up enough that it didn't get so repetative as I imagined it would. A fun game and very, very impressive for 1 weeks worth."

Nighttime is based on annoying the player by darkening the field rather than shortening the actual field of view which I didnt like, and the directional movement doesnt allow for strafing meaning that to move one tile to the diagonal and still be facing the same direction takes 4 keypresses instead of 1.\n    2 - Low-fi graphical tiles, some of them are really unrecognizable. Even after playing for some time I couldn't distingish sock from boot.\n    2 - Nice look. Movement controls interact nicely with gameplay. Keyboard commands to interact with items are all mnemonic, but only one of them actually uses the first letter of the word! Inventory interaction requires mouse clicking anyway.",

Probably just enough to call it roguelike-like.\n    3 - Ticks most of the boxes. Tactical combat replaced with extra resource management.",
    "reviewText": "Dropped naked from a plane onto a snow and ice filled landscape, all you know is that salvation lies to one of the compass directions. So you grab your parachute for a makeshift blanket, that tattered left sock you notice sticking out of the snow, and boldly head off in that direction! ... No wait ok, so its getting dark and the sun sets in the west and that means if the shadows of the trees are facing that way then... THAT direction! Hah! A False Saint, An Honest Rogue is a survival game with a unique and initially confusing method of movement where the arrow keys will change the direction you are facing, and you can only actually move forward and back. Its made even more disorienting with figuring out which way to go via the sun (which is only reliable at sunset and sunrise). Once you are over these things though, and have your bearings, its rather fun to trudge through the snow occasionally looking around for food or clothing to keep you from dying, and hoovering up the trinkets left behind in the snow by others. I think if the FOV and movement is worked on a little more, some extra content like combat and other things to do except get to the end asap, then this game will definately be one to come back to.\n    Survival in a nothern wilderness. Don't starve. Don't freeze to death. There is a lot of items scattered around. But you don't have time to collect them all. Spend your time wisely!\n    A harsh non-combat survival simulator in a procedural environment. Novel survival mechanics make up for the lack of tactical combat. Temperature mechanic is forgiving enough to give you time to find clothing and interesting  before dying, and shadow mechanics make it possible to win without having to find said items. Navigating around obstacles feels awkward because the map display changes every time you change direction (so taking a single diagonal step takes four keypresses)."

It's a high score game that ends when you either die or run out of time/turns. I felt like it's missing some elements that could get you out of dead ends. Some items or special moves may be. It's fun to play a little.\n    If you crossed classic platformers (Loadrunner, Super Mario Bros) with some of the elements of roguelikes (randomly generated maps, turn-based, only a single life) you'd end up with something like Bump! It's simple enough to jump right into without the need for instructions and it's browser-based, so firing it up and playing takes just seconds. Simple yet challenging and requiring some thought and strategy. A solid entry in this year's competition.\n    This is definitely one of the better games in the competition. Also one of the most innovative, there's literally nothing to compare it to. It's only flaw is that it gets repetitive. It's just a straight run for points over time.

A few touches like the necromancer, ghost types, and unique characters help keep the game fresh as you decend levels.\n    2 - It's an interesting mechanic, providing a regenerating health buffer, but it doesn't change the game fundamentally. Still, it's something new and unusual, and I appreciate that.\n    2 - Standard roguelike stuff.

    "reviewText": "\"I live again\". You play an undead warrior of some sort whom has achieved free will for a short time. In order to keep your free will you must slay the evil, nay vile necromancer that has enslaved you and many like you. Unfortunately only you seem to be in control of yourself and you must fight your way through the mindless undead to reach your final goal. There are some tough battles to be had, but once you understand the health system and the replenishing of health flasks each level, the game borders on a tad too easy. Of course balance is very hard to achieve in a 7DRL so no forgiveness needed there, it is better to by too easy than too hard. The game takes influences from a number of roguelike games, whether on purpose or not, but I felt reminded of Crawl, Moria/Angband and DoomRL while playing. Also I was reminded of the game Blood from many years ago, I would of loved some flares to set my enemies on fire... This game is really worth playing and was obviously written by a roguelike fan with a true appreciation of the genre. \n    The main feature of this 7DRL, the health system, is an interesting modification of the typical HP system. The trick in surviving, thus, lies in recognizing when your non-regenerating health bar is in danger and retreating to refill the buffer. Additionally, there are things like poison and bleeding to spice it up. I liked the idea, and the execution is solid, but there could be more. There are a few interesting items, but I was confused about the function of some of them. Anyway, to sum it up, a neat twist on a genre stereotype, but a little bit empty.\n    You are an undead warrior that tries to use it's remains of willpower to break free from necromancers control. You fight his minions, picking some weapons and items in the meanwhile, and finally fight him. Your health regenerates very quickly, but once you are out of health, your remains of willpower will be drained. So you can kill regular enemies without thinking, but take bosses very carefully."

One niggle is that fast multiple keystrokes are often ignored - pressing up and immediately right will just ignore the second keystroke, for instance, which makes navigating the long mazes increasingly tedious.  The help menu promises additional info from the space key, but nothing seems to happen when this is pressed.  Tested this on Windows, which worked fine - the release page has source available and it relies on SDL, so it could probably be compiled on Linux too, although I didn't take the time to try this.",

On the second level it's really really hard to distinguish corner cells from regular wall. But desaturation for out of field of view tiles looks nice. And escape that immediately end the game is really annoying.\n    3 - Looks very nice. FOV is well done and level color themes are great. Little flashes on combat are a nice touch.\n    3 - Clean interface that's very easy to navigate - there are only a small handful of keys, and they're clearly explained.  However, I often found myself wishing for more options to choose from, and a bit more feedback - there doesn't seem to be any way to examine the monsters you're fighting, and little opportunity to guess whether you're likely to win a fight or not.",

Combat also never feels very threatening, and it seems to take a very long time to earn enough resources for a new ability. But mostly it's the mazes.\n    2 - A nice and clean, logical hack and slash adventure. One thing I found annoying was the reliance on the \"regeneration\" perk - without this, there appears to be no way to heal whatsoever, so even the simplest levels can be deadly without it.  With it, the entire game becomes very easy.  The monsters respawn randomly, which takes away a lot of the fun of completely clearing out a level, since this is impossible. The levels are intended to feel varied in their layout, but really only the background changes - ultimately there are only two tile types.",

Nothing too crazy but there is still some nuance in the mechanics and theme that obviously took some time.\n    2 - A fairly minimal roguelike that still manages to fit in a few interesting features and game mechanics, but often leaves me wishing there was just a bit more feedback, a bit more info about the enemies, and a greater ramp in difficulty to complete the game.",

The main gameplay difference is you have to find multiple fixed points on a map to exit, rather than just one.",
    "reviewText": "You are a virus that tries to infect an organism. On each level (which is an organ) you have to infect all corner cells. While doing this you will kill different defenders, gather parts and purchase traits with this parts. Sounds interesting, but once you purchase regeneration, which regenerates 1 hp per turn, the game become trivial. But without regeneration it is pretty much impossible to progress deeper. Worth to try it once.\n    Heavily themed game will have you searching autoimmune terms on wikipedia. Lymphocytes, t-cells, B-cells, and all sorts of other unpronouncable enemies will assault you in a series of mazes representing different areas of the body. Some interesting choices in ability selection, but it takes a while to earn enough resources to buy them. Combat rarely feels threatening. Game shows lots of polish in some areas, the menus are intuitive and the game itself does color selection very nicely. Levels are almost all mazes, and in some cases you must traverse the entire maze to discover the \"cornerstone\" blocks... this can get tedious depending on how you feel about mazes. Either way it is a great educational tool and a good-looking example of a solid 7DRL.\n    A medical twist on this roguelike; you play a microscopic invader inside an organism, and the monsters you fight are antibodies and other microscopic entities.  Killing them lets you gain various kinds of upgrades.  Exiting a level requires you to find and destroy each of the corner cells, but doing so produces an instant transition which seems a bit jarring when you haven't actually passed through an exit.  While a nice idea, the medical concept and enemies healing each other didn't really seem to affect the way I found myself playing at all, simply barrelling into the nearest enemy repeatedly until it died and wandering around the maps until I found all the corner cells to exit.  I think a bit more could have been made of the special abilities, as it's easy to complete the game without ever even getting most of the upgrades."

Unfortunately the \"broken\" look chosen results in a lot of dirty tiles with dithering,  Dithering simple doesn't work at this res. Really should have kept the res of the tiles down to avoid this temptation.  And then it would also run unmodified on a sub-HD laptop.  The real killer, however, is the interface.  Quitting on death is annoying in 2013.  No autopickup of arrows? Confirmation of firing is enter, not the fire key?  (If I hit f to fire, f should confirm.  Likewise, 1 for lightningbolt should confirm with a second 1)  vi-keys are cool, but why not arrow keys?  Why separate open and get commands?  \n    1 - While tiles themself look stylish, but colored monsters and water look a little alien in this black and white world.

With HP regen so high and no monster regen, it seems one is trading boredom vs diving.  I'd rather be able to just dive when I get the stair and rely on the developer to set the pace better.\n    2 - It is mildly amusing to figure how things work in this game.

The most serious problem about this game is magic. It is somewhat useful at the start, but after you gain some levels, you can totally ignore it. Which is not right thing in the game that is supposedly centered around the magic.\n    An enjoyable dungeon delving run. Lovely interface, a clean graphical style and an enjoyable and innovative rotating spell system.

There is a bit of lag between each turn making movement and fights frustratingly slow. Its reasonably easy to enter the final stage first thing and win without seeing any other content. The procedural content in this game is very undercooked, with every tile not special to the boss section being a random pick of several terrain types for the level, which also makes it possible to begin an area trapped behind a wall of blocking terrain.\n    3 - I didn't find any bugs, seems to be complete. You can defeat the tyrant, so it's winnable.",

The UI is mostly good, although I had a hard time noticing when the messages scrolled.\n    1 - There are a number of unusual choices of glyphs for the terrain, occasionally making floor hard to guess from wall especially through the very visually complex level layout. Colors are often similar to the background (dark blue walls or enemies on black background) or each other (brown rats brown ground brown walls), or areas without LOS (grey floor in LOS and ever so slightly darker gray out of LOS) - very often making it difficult to fight and walk around and see clearly whats what. This is all contrasted by the rainbow of colors that make up the hud, which has the same problem but for the opposite reason since its difficult to see what is and isn't important when everything is clamboring to stand out the most.\n    2 - I nearly gave the game a '1' here.

Even with the final boss fight it feels as though there is no difference in completing the other areas or not. Add some consequence of choice in, possibly unlocking abilities at each area or something, and Nightmare Tyrant could have a good twist over other more linear games.\n    2 - Nothing incredibly innovative here, but I very much like the choice of zones (or quests).

It really looks great, and I will definitely aspire to make my own games look as good.  The nonlinear quest structure is a neat idea, although it was implemented as a menu rather than, say, areas attached to a hub zone.  I was a little unclear on what the Stamina stat was for, as I ran out of it with no apparent problems.  The quests don't include any loot or character upgrades, so there isn't a compelling reason (other than exploration) to do them first.  The author made the crossbow a slow and powerful weapon, and I'm really delighted by that bit of realism.  As it is, it's very worth checking out, and there's a lot of potential to build on.\n    A dark shadow looms over the village - a Nightmare Tyrant is invading dreams and consuming souls! Empowered by fear, you can choose to weaken it by removing the things that the villagers fear from their lives before meeting it in the final match. These are represented by several areas which can be completed prior to the final area should you choose - but unfortunately there seems to be little real consequence in doing so. The soupy dungeon generator, laggy turns and terrible choices of glyphs and colors all make for some agitating gameplay, but underlying all that is a decent game with a neat idea.\n    This is a pretty mainstream playing roguelike with a very cool feature, it allows you to choose the quest or zone you want to dive into. It reminds me a bit of how Megaman would allow you to choose which boss to go after. The presentation can make your eyes bleed a bit, but other than that it's a solid entry into this year's 7DRL. Note there is a 'gold' edition with some updates, check that one out for sure."

    "reviewText": "You must kill everything on the map. Seems simple, except that when you kill a monster, you become the monster, and each monster has its specificity that you must take it into account to figure out how to clean the map. While this seems promising, it turns out very difficult to use. What could have been a chess-like game turns into an unmanageable challenge due to unconsistent monster feats. Maybe trying to remove as much as possible from the game would make it better. For example, something as simple as monsters being able to attack only in one direction could have worked better.\n    This game has a fairly unique concept - that when you kill an enemy, you become that enemy.  This is an interesting mechanic with a lot of potential, however in this case it suffers in execution simply because there are so many enemy types with such different abilities and tactics required both to use and defeat them.  This gives the game not so much a learning curve as a learning cliff since in order to play the game effectively or even understand what is going on you need to absorb information about all of the different monsters and their abilities, which is at first overwhelming and requires some real persistance in order to uncover the tactics needed to make it past even the first level.  The game could have benefitted from trimming down its roster to fewer monsters with more easily understandable abilities or at least limiting the monster types that could appear in the early stages in order to give a smoother introduction to the game.  As is, I suspect not many people will succeed in breaking though to the interesting and rewarding tactical gameplay that lies underneath.\n    A very fun little game that I personally enjoyed. My only problem with it was that you weren't always destined to win the levels, if you were a healer and a jumper was close by you were pretty screwed. I found myself NOT using items that much actually, they never were that useful in the levels I played with the sole exception of the healing potion, which I used whenever I got it."

Lacks some specific setting to really stand apart, but if it were possible to save the game, it could be a good coffee break game.\n    Alchemy sets you against a dungeon to potion your way down and find the philosophers stone. There are boatloads of items to be found, and few enemies. While the enemies seem to increase in number and difficulty later on, it makes for a slow early game. The alchemy portion of the game allows you to combine items into potions, but the mechanic isn't really very core to the game because existing potions can be found in an abundance. This game has some good potential though, since it has a decent interface, and has all the other roguelike basics down properly. With some tightening up of gameplay, more importance placed on the alchemy mechanic, and a bit of extra balancing to make all levels equally as interesting, it will certainly be one to come back to."

    "reviewText": "Having the combat as scrolls only is a nice idea...in theory. I understand that it complied with the setting(The Library of Alexandria) but considering the scrolls were randomly generated it didn't make the game particularly enjoyable, having very few scrolls for attack. I had at least one playthrough that involved having only one attack scroll, and the corpse detonation skill wasn't helpful in the least. I wish I could like it more, but it was a mildly frustrating game.\n    This little gem derives it's gameplay from a fun gimmick. You cannot attack in melee. Instead you must cast a variety of spells to defeat or avoid the baddies and pass the level. Or you can just plain run for your life. It plays well, very smooth. Everything is clear in what it does. It has a nice difficulty curve. You could play this one for a few hours without getting bored. Overall a very solid entry.\n    Escape from the Library of Alexandria, which is full of sand, scrolls, bodies, and more-or-less Egyptian-themed monsters trying to kill you. Consuming the strictly limited supply of scrolls and terrain features is the only way to damage or bypass enemies. Most monster attacks interact with the use of scrolls in some way.  A complete experience in its current state, but with room left over for new monsters, spells, and enemies. My only gripe is with the AI; it seems totally random whether enemies with line-of-sight notice you, and they sometimes break off pursuit for no reason. Finite supply of attack spells makes it profitable to avoid killing non-damaging monsters, but their random AI makes it a grind to get past them in a corridor."

You spend around 3 minutes per level, in best case. You need at least 2 hours to beat the game! \n    1 - The maps were large with little variation in design and plenty of dead ends. Because they were on the large side and you could not 'run' through the levels by holding down the arrow keys, you had to click a million miles to get from one end of the map to the other with very little to do in between.\n    1 - While the concept is interesting, as-implemented it's not much fun.

Equipping too high-level gear reduces the drop-rate of enemy equipment, but as there is plenty lying around anyway there seems little advantage to downgrading until absolutely necessary.",

You need to equip weaker and weaker items to have a chance to kill incoming heroes without destroying their items. It's a nice concept, but current implementation it lacks veriety. 10 floors higher you are doing exactly the same thing. Numbers are changing slowly, but that's the only difference. Absense of autorun or click to run there kind of controls makes traversal of pretty big levels very cumbersome. But it's still very good for a first roguelike!\n    I was looking forward to playing this because of the 'reverse' concept it promised where I had to level down instead of levelling up but I saw no reason to comply to the rules because that would mean extra effort for little to no reward on my part. Instead I found myself overpowered so that it's easier to kill the baddies and then just equip myself with lower levelled gear for the ending.\n    This one is definitely on the 'interesting idea' end of the spectrum, not so much the fun end.  You start at maximum power and must ascend through the dungeon downgrading your equipment as you go.  The potential for strategic gameplay suggested by this idea is undermined by the lack of pay-off for downgrading and the tedium of exploring the dungeon.  Would be improved by greatly shortening the game and by tightening the trade-off between short- and long-term gain in downgrading your equipment."

You can crouch or crawl to reduce the likelihood of startling your target, but this reduces your visibility and speed too.  Overall it's a startlingly realistic roguelike simulation of a real life scenario, and one i'd recommend to any lover of the genre as something just that bit different and cool.  The one thing missing is the lack of any real win scenario - once you run out of shots, you are left to wander the savannah endlessly, waiting to be poisoned by a passing snake."

However the controls are archaic - requires 'o' and direction for every door you pass through for instance. The changing direction of FOV makes exploration very frustrating.\n    1 - It look pretty standard for a python+libtcod, but there are a few things that makes playing this game really annoyng. The way directional fov works here makes you press keys twice most of the time. Visited, but unseen atm tile is indistinguishable from unexplored. Now in addition to double keypresses you have to visit some places twice. You have to press o to open the door and then direction. The same for chat. Insane amount of extra keypresses that aren't really necessary.\n    2 - Clean ASCII, good choice of font. The display is a tad busy for my tastes, but overall very serviceable. The commands seem to be obvious once you learn them, but there are quite a few. Not as many as some of the classic roguelikes, but nowadays this is a bit too many.",
    "ft": "2 - The game is very slow to play, which kinda ruins the whole experience. The directional FOV is interesting, but there's no way to actually game it, so it ends up frustrating rather than fun.\n    2 - It's moderately fun once you figure out that you can run away from most enemies. But directional fov here is more of nuisance than first rate element of gameplay. Yes, you can stab the enemy in the back. But you do this by random occasion much more often than because you made this situation.\n    2 - This game is fun enough, but I found the FoV system to be a real pain. It's a very interesting mechanic, it just didn't seem to be used for anything besides making me confused.",

Facing in roguelikes has been done before and better many times.\n    1 - Indian theme is interesting, but here it more of facade that hide pretty traditional roguelike. It doesn't add new elements to gameplay. Directional fov was done before and more successfully.\n    2 - This is hard to score. On the face of it there is quite a bit of innovation here. There's an interesting Indian theme I've never seen used, but seems to be more of a vocabulary change than anything else. The gameplay is straight classic roguelike. The player still picks Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, etc and then plunges into the dungeon as usual. The Field of View is also an interesting mechanic, it just seemed to not due much for the gameplay. So as much as I want to give this a 3 on innovation, I'm going with a 2 here.",

    "rt": "3 - Very classic roguelike.\n    3 - True roguelike.\n    3 - This is as straight a roguelike as you'll find. Which is awesome.",
    "reviewText": "A game with an Indian theme, facing tigers with tulwars and the like. The unconventional terms for everything can be confusing, but it is nice to see something different than the usual fantasy or sci-fi fare. It has directinal facing with weak-points on backs, but there's little way to take advantage of this as there are no movement skills to close in on enemies or escape them when they see you. The constant need to change direction as you move makes for very slow exploration around levels that are far too big for the content spread around them. Smaller levels, slicker controls (bump to open doors or chat) and a sprint ability could work to make this a much more compelling game.\n    The game dosn't tell you what is the aim, but aparently you need to kill the demon on 5th floor. The game features directional fov and is set in indian setting. But the fov only annoys, and indian setting is mostly renaming traditional classes and items into unfamiliar terms. What is sad that with several easy tweaks this one could be much better.\n    This is a rock solid entry into this years competition, hitting everything you want to see in a 7DRL by the numbers. It's a straight roguelike, adhering to all classic elements including ASCII display, lots of stats, obtuse key commands, tons of content, a fantasy and magical setting, etc...Beyond that classic style, it does bring 2 innovations. The first is the Indian theme. This is the only Roguelike I know of that uses ancient India as the setting, it's worth checking out just for that. The second innovation, one that's problematic, is the direction FoV mechanic. You basically cannot see outside of where you are facing. That's sounds very cool in a simulationist sort of way, but it hampers the fun of the game a bit. So go check out this uniquely themed Roguelike for yourself, it's heavy on content and full of interesting features."

For some odd reason, while packs of mana potions are blue, big ones are red - oversight, or intended confusion?

    "reviewText": "There are several design/mechanics decisions that make the game worse than it could be. First - the mage is always the target. No matter how you change the formation. If you place your mage behind the warrior, enemies can hit him, but he can't attack them with diagnostics 'The mage is blocked by worrior'. Second - health/mana potions are used upon picking. You have to run around alot when party starts to take some serious damage. You can't pick weapon and not pick potion in the same tile even if you don't need potion at all. It's a nice try, worth checking, but it could be better without much effort.\n    This is a very innovative game where each tile on the grid is split into more tiles. The game play seemed to involve a great deal of running about that tended to wear thin. Over all though it's a pretty solid entry I would recommend to anyone seeking to find out just how a game can be highly innovative AND stick pretty strongly to the roguelike formula.\n    We heard you liked roguelikes, so we put tiles inside your tiles so you can play while you play. Each tile in TriQuest consists of nine subtiles. You can arrange the order of your three-member party on these subtiles, although it's hard to actually make this useful. Character progression consists of getting items to fill out a total of six slots (each member uses their own item set), and once you have an item, all the other possible ways to fill the slot are sidegrades (I think some equipment combinations might dominate others, though). For that amount of progression, the world map is far too large - I never even managed to see the end boss, for having to wander around and trying to remember where all the consumables are."

Even without a deathscreen, though that would be nice but assuming the developer was unable to provide one due to time constraint, I was still gearing up to go again. It has your garden variety of rats, gnomes, trolls and many more creatures to kill with plenty of loot to pick up. Be wary of higher level weapons that might be lesser in terms of kill points depending on the creature you encounter!\n    Uushuvud is as mysterious as the name implies. Make sure to read the README very carefully so that you know how to get off the first level. Also be careful not to pick up weapons weaker than the one you already have -- your previous (better) weapon seems to disappear when you pick a new one up.\n\nAesthetically Uushuvud is nice to look at -- excellent use of simple colors and simple menu / item system is perfect for a 7DRL. Lots of descriptive text sets this one a apart."

Would be more interesting with more tactical gameplay added.\n    A nice \"concept\" game (you play two roguelikes simultaneously). Fun to try out, though a bit let down by bugs and lack of early-game balance. Would potentially be a very good game if given a bit more time for polishing - always the challenge in 7DRLs!\n    A very competently put-together game with an extremely interesting twist - that you are controlling two characters at once in two separate games.  While that does add a fun new element to the game, my main complaint is that I don't think it was taken far enough.  I would dearly love to see some more experimentation on this theme that explores other ways in which the game's two realities could be linked together - shared equipment, items etc. or differentiated (different monsters, game rules etc. in each).  I think there is the potential here for something genuinely mind-blowing."

However soon enough you and your apprentices find yourselves out of spells and health. Thankfully you had time to admire the pretty garden flowers or quiet pool surrounding you before dying.  All in all a nice try with an interesting mechanic. Standard libtcod look and feel. And I guess I know what happened to the other wizard, he could not clear the first level either!\n    The game is definitely worth to try. What is really impressing about this game is level of details of tower. A lot of things around. Even the ice box contains items appropriate for the ice box. Too bad all that have no impact on gameplay. This game shows that wizards and their apprentices are superglutons. You need to eat after every single spell. That's cumbersome. There is a lot of food around, so you don't need to manage it. Just eat. A lot. And there are layouts where fighting basilisc is almost impossible.\n    You are a mage with two apprentices, going on a dungeon crawl. The apprentices are something between a pet and another player character. You can order them around and tell them to cast spells, but losing the game is still tied to your main avatar. The game is quite polished, but also sticks to traditional roguelike UI. You should be fighting by casting spells at a range, but spells need way more keyboard work than just bumping to attack, so I ended up just seeing what I can kill by bumping into it and repeatedly dying."

Direction keys and space bar to pick up and equip items. It looks neat and has a real sense of humor. The issue I had with it was the lack of game play variety. All the enemies are stronger or weaker versions of some base type, as well as all weapons and armor. A valiant try, definitely. If you want to know how a solid roguelike might look and play, check this out. If you are looking for challenge, variety and fun there are other options.\n    This game has a lot of character created through its graphics, animation and sound, yet sadly its gameplay has not received the same level of care and attention.  The equipment system is nice, but as it is a purely linear progression of armour and weapons it and the purely bump-based combat system mean that the player's options are always fairly limited and uninteresting.  Does show some promise, however - would dearly love to see the nice graphical base built on with a more complex set of gameplay mechanics and better balancing."

For my tastes, the art assets were a little small compared to the space. I would've rather had scrollable space with a minimap.\n    3 - All the spaceships look nice and are pretty easy to differentiate.  The grid system lets you see where you are in 3D space and makes things much less confusing then they could have been.  The color-coding on the ships helps you understand what is going on at a glance, without too much hassle.",

A lot of things to do, so the pace is very slow.\n    2 - I think this game would be fun for certain players but it doesn't really hit any of my roguelike buttons. It also has quite a steep learning curve, which is not a BAD thing, but does tend to get in the way of fun (at first)\n    2 - This game was really more of a squad-based tactics game than a roguelike, which isn't really a genre I like, so I'm somewhat biased against the game in this respect.  Since you are giving orders to each unit at once, and the orders are fairly complex (movement in 3 dimensions, actions against planets or other ships) the game moves very slowly.  Also, there's really no room for surprises in the game - you know what enemies you're going to face and what sort of ships and planets you'll encounter from the beginning.  A fan of a squad-based tactics game would probably like this, but it wasn't really for me.",

Tactical gameplay in 3D space with plenty of non-combat (resource mining, fleet size management) strategy.\n    2 - The 3D space combat system is certainly original.

I didn't get far enough to see the end of the game, but there were clear goals from the beginning and it seems like there is a clearly defined end to the game.  There doesn't seem to be a huge amount of depth - there's a handful of ship types, module types, and enemy types, but they're all based around gaining or destroying one of the many resources you have to manage.",
    "rt": "1 - The game is turn based and have some random elements. But that's all. Squad based space tactics in 3d space is very far from roguelikes.\n    1 - Definitely NOT a roguelike. This is a squad tactics game with random levels.\n    1 - The only roguelike elements are turn-based gameplay, randomized maps in each sector you visit, and resource management.  This game is really more of a squad tactics game with random elements than a roguelike with squad tactics elements.",
    "reviewText": "It's hard to judge this game, as it has very very weak connection with roguelikes. It is set in 3d space, you give order to multiple ships and these orders are simultaneously executed during the turn. Position and qualities of objects in each star system are random, but I can't really say that they create significally different tactical situations. It's interesting game, and as far as I can tell it's actively developed post 7drl, but it's just not roguelike.\n    A great little tactical squad turn-based game. Unfortunately it is not really a roguelike, but the game has surprising depth for a 7DRL attempt. Using your fleet of ships, battle enemies and gather resources on a full 3D grid. Learning curve is a bit steep but things get going fast once the bad guys get in range. Worth a play if you are a fan of x-com or other squad-based tactics games.\n    A tactical game where the player controls a fleet of ships trying to avoid the \"Sleepers\" while tracking down and destroying their bases.  Draws clear inspiration from Battlestar Galactica - the fleet is perpetually low on resources, and must convince lone ships to join them while scavenging from planets, wreckage, and abandoned bases.  The gameplay ultimately feels more like an old squad-based tactical space battle sim than a roguelike, although the resource managment and random areas are clearly drawn from the roguelike genre.  Ultimately I didn't care for the game simply because it's not a genre I particularly like.  However, others may enjoy it."

But other than that it's pretty simple hack&slash experience. Keeping that balance isn't really exciting or interesting. But it's a nice experiment.\n    This game is the epitome of a classic style roguelike scoped out to 7 days. You explore, kill, get loot, drink from fountains, go deeper... I feel that compared to other reviews Ive completed I haven't said a lot, but there really isn't much to say: there is nothing particularly good or bad or memorable about this game. That said its well polished, shows a good understanding of all the aspects which make up an aesthetic game, and a no-frills roguelike. It can be considered a blank canvas of a roguelike upon which anything could be painted, and I hope we get to see more soon.\n    A HTML5 roguelike that runs easily and is quick to figure out, might be good as a very quick introduction to roguelikes if some of the screen space was used to show the list of keys. Very much standard fantasy hack-n-slash fare. Solidly executed for a 7DRL. I played about ten games and won three."

In multiplayer mode you try to die last, so there could be some competitive potential there, but single-player seems incomplete.  Even one or more AIs to compete against would be a good addition.  The spells are pretty neat, but there's not much chance to play around with them when you're frantically fighting off a large horde.\n    2 - Pretty good fun. The competitive element makes it a good enjoyable game with a friend. The different spells are fun to try out too.\n    3 - Definitely fun, though multiplayer naturally plays to this strength. The balance between trying to improve your character whilst trying to destroy your opponents is great! The real-time clock on moves takes a bit of the fun away, but there's enough here to keep you coming back when you get the chance.",

Players go turn by turn, but have a chess timer on their moves, encouraging them to play fast where possible. You build up strength against enemies, but must at some point use this on your competitors. Some very original mechanics!",
    "st": "2 - Pretty standard in terms of complexity.\n    1 - Not a particularly big scope - the game plays on just one level with a relatively small set of enemies. There is some variety in the level graphics but that doesn't seem to affect gameplay.\n    2 - On the low side - only 1 level and few monster types.",

Otherwise, standard grid-based random map and random monsters are pretty usual.\n    2 - The gameplay is definitely quite roguelike (turn based movement, spells etc). The time limit is a bit non-roguelike, but makes sense in the context (a fast paced multiplayer mini-game). Not so much in the way of dungeon exploration.\n    2 - Lack of real procedural content really hurts this, and the real-time clock doesn't help a great deal either. Close to a 1, but it does still retain a lot of roguelike feel.",
    "reviewText": "Versus Time is well-made overall, but the emphasis on multi-player severely detracts from the experience.  Roguelikes are (almost?) universally single-player, so I think the RL community is not the best one to release this game to.  The control scheme for accomodating four players at the same keyboard using one hand each is frankly genius, but to actually have four people playing at once would require having very thin and/or secure friends.  Some possible ways around the single-player issue would be implementing online multiplayer (which is waaaaaay outside the scope of a 7DRL) or implementing a bot AI to replace one or more players (which would be much harder than it sounds).  That aside, I like almost everything else: the graphics are beautiful, the spells are clever, and the mechanic of using the time-to-live resource to cast spells is awesome.  The game's a bit hard, but maybe having more players would make it easier to break out of a mob of monsters ganging up on you.\n    A good little game - simple but definitely worth a few plays with a friend if you want to test out your competitive roguelike-playing mettle. \n    Multiple players take turns to move, attack or use an ability, but mindful of a real-time clock that ticks down on your turn. Enemies keep spawning, and killing them efficiently can lead to extra resources and improvements. But victory only comes from beating other players, and choosing the opportune moment to stab your friend in the back is an important part of the fun of the game. With 2 players it's cagey and tight, with 4 palyers it's manic and fun. A really interesting take on multiplayer roguelikery!"

There seems to be a bit of an issue with the AI, but I liked it all around. All the standards like inventory and combat are done well and true to the classic form, but the added wrinkle that you can get NPCS to fight with you. It looks Corremn is continuing to update this one a bit, so by the time these reviews come out the game will be even better.\n    A fairly standard dungeon (technically starts outdoors, but mechanically identical) crawler. You can pick up allies with a Leadership stat, but they seem to bug out pretty easily and almost never came with me, so little benefit there. Otherwise it's fairly repetitive.

Use chalk to delay the opponent if you get trapped in a dead end. Not much to do, but a very polished interface. Every level needs the same tactics.\n    A fun little browser roguelike.

    "reviewText": "A cute game that will probably be really fun in the future but isn't at the moment. Because of severe balance issues it's very difficult to progress. You start with so low weapon damage it's very easy to get in a situation where there's too many enemies to get past, and the random placement of power ups means you might not get anything that will help you. The areas you traverse seem very cramped so even though there's kind of some path choices you basically are on a linear route. No strategy to speak of, just standard platforming fare.\n    Well-done game, and I did genuinely have fun playing it for awhile. I'm not that interested in real-time platforming, so not much replay value. Well put-together. Especially in the time allowed."

    "reviewText": "A solitaire-like card game that uses a six-sided die to add randomization. It's somewhat interesting in that it's you (the player/troll) versus the cards and the die. The complexity was a bit much for me to digest. If I was willing to spend a few hours with this, perhaps I'd get more into it but the fun wasn't enough to draw me in.\n    A very interesting attempt at a roguelike played with only a deck of cards and a 6-sided die.  You start the game by creating a \"bridge\" of cards, and putting your character (a troll, represented by any token you like) on the bridge.  Every turn, cards attempt to escape the bridge and your troll must prevent them from leaving.  If enough cards escape, the bridge collapses.  This alone makes for a compelling \"race against the clock\" as you scramble around the bridge trying to smash the cards back into place.  A bit more depth is added by the ability to pick up cards and use them as items.  The items do suffer from a few balance issues - for instance, picking up a diamond lets you attack an escaping card from any distance (the diamond represents a throwing star), while picking up a club does the same thing, but only within melee range.  It seemed to me that clubs should have an additional power to prevent them from being completely inferior to diamonds.  Nevertheless, this is a short, fun (and difficult!) game that anyone with access to a deck of cards should try at least once.\n    This is a single player card game similar to solitaire, though perhaps a bit more complex. It's a pretty interesting entry into this year's competition. It uses only the standard 52 card deck, standard dice and some marker for your troll. You can use a salt shaker or a poker chip. It's easy for just about anyone to play."

These and many other illusion based spells make for a neat tactical game that unfortunately gets too hard too quickly. Still, its well worth a shot, and I look forward to any future balancing and features.\n    A basic roguelike clone with the focus on using illusion spells to trick enemies into trap. The choice of illusion spells is interesting but unfortunately there is not much else in the game except some basic enemies that chase you while you look for traps to lure them into (which may not even exist in the level).\n    A game where you can cast illusions to help you penetrate the fortress. As far as I understand, these illusions do not cause any real effects, they only change how the monsters behave (for example, you can hide a pit, making monsters likely to fall into it). I think that this is an interesting idea, and it could have potential, but more work would be required... I have won."

This is very easy to do, and in fact it's more of a challenge to \"lose\" the game (if recovering from depression can be called losing) than to reach any particular depth. There doesn't seem to be any final level, so this may be the intended message. The graphics strike an ideal balance between whimsy and grimness.\n    This is a beautiful and funny little game about being sad and depressed. The text in the game is full of witty little jokes and what not. The controls are tight as well. The draw back to this game is that it sort of makes you want to quit after a bit. Get down dozens and dozens of levels until you get depressed and want to stop...wait...maybe that's the point...maybe this game is brilliant."

Your hands are empty is a strange message when I have four slots - maybe your pouch is empty and proc it on all pouches.  It also is strange to have the fourth slot reserved for the skull - I'd have expected to be able to swap it out for a mushroom.  One other solution is to make the special slot skull shaped to make it clear it only has one use.  When I die with an idol in my inventory, it still stays I haven't got even one idol.  There is a draw order problem where mushrooms seem to move as they are drawn in the new position before/after the background map.  I'd recommend either double buffering or making sure you draw both items and tiles in the same pass.  You can't eat mushrooms when healthy - this makes it hard to swap a red for a green.  Since you also can't choose not to pickup (and a red mushroom may block your path) this really hurts the resource management game.\n    2 - Playable and fairly bug-free, though dying and winning both seem to result in crashing.\n    3 - Seems pretty complete for what it's trying to do.",
    "at": "1 - I love the look of the ascii.  Very well rendered.  A good example of actually using lots of garish colours together successfully!  Base camp, however, shouldn't disappear when it is out of FOV.  It could also due with being made a more garish colour as it is very depressing to not be able to find it.  So what merits a one?  The controls.  To be fair, touch controls for a roguelike are likely an unsolved problem.  But slide move is just painful.  It might work if you had very few movement commands, but there is a lot of wandering over open space in SkullDorado (which is a good thing, it is an explore/backtrack game!  So do not think an answer is to cut out the wandering!)  This needs to be easy and fun.  But there are also the battles where each move matters.  Slide move solves the latter problem, but butchers the exploration experience. I found I could do a sort of quick tap-slide to move somewhat less painfully, but I'd get about a 50% tap triggering spurious door closes and waits.  And then I'd still use that to fight a monster and end up waiting beside a jaguar by accident.  Tap to move would be better - detect which quadrant with respect to the @ the person taps in, and move that way.  Put a reasonable deadspace in the center for holding still.  Allow keyrepeats on the tap so you can press and hold to have the @ wander around by spiraling your pressed finger around the outside of the screen.  Long distance movement has to be fun.  And, no, I do not think path finding is an answer as it destroys the feeling of exploring between the places.  You do want the user building a visceral knowledge of the map by walking each square, but you don't want to force them to do a complicated gesture for each square.\n    2 - Nice clean colourful tiles.  Drag-to-move works OK but gets a little annoying on long journeys.\n    3 - Very colorful with a solid UI. Its the jungle theme well.",

Definitely a game that rewards good spatial memory, while the combat system isn't meant to be center stage, it comes out remarkably balanced for a 7drl.\n    2 - The lost city theme provides some interesting atmosphere, but the game itself doesn't have a lot to it yet.  The only items are healing mushrooms, making for little tactical depth, and the hunt-the-idol objective is a little tedious and of random difficulty - sometimes the idol is in a far flung corner of the map and sometimes it's in the room next door.  There are only a few enemies, but each one is fairly distinctive in behaviour and well-done.\n    2 - Pretty fun, theme helps it quite a bit.",

Beautifully rendered and with a reasonable balance, SkullDorado's main flaw is a crippling control scheme.  If that can be fixed, it may make a fun coffebreak game to play on a commute.\n    SkullDorado tasks you with exploring a lost city to find an idol and return it back to your starting point.  There are monsters to fight along the way but other than that there is not a whole lot more to it - there's not much of a tactical aspect to the combat and winning is largely down to luck - how far away the idol has spawned and whether or not you can find enough healing mushrooms to offset the damage you'll take.  Despite this, the game does have a fair amount of charm to it and what is there is fairly solid.  I would definitely be interested in playing a more developed version.\n    This is a fun little roguelike, not all that complex, but the basics are there. I enjoy the theme and presentation. Loved the jaguars and monkeys! Using symbols instead of letters helped spark the imagination."

Attaching limbs is a nice aspect but the game does not really have enough depth or content to really bring it home.\n    2 - Switching limbs is pretty fun.

In the end though, it amounted to just a humourous reskinning of the standard roguelike inventory mangement. You make choices between big strong hard hitting weapons/limbs like the troll arm with a club, or fast and speedy limbs like the kobold legs.\n    2 - This game has one aspect that is unique enough (at least for people who have not played IVAN that is); limb attachment!  Perhaps not fully developed as I would of liked, it is a little hard to know what different limbs really give you.\n    2 - Replacing lost limbs isn't really new, but there are very few games with this kind of mechanics.

    "reviewText": "The game focuses on the idea of attaching and reattaching limbs to customize your hero. You can choose to attach things like troll limbs to do immense damage, or kobold legs to be very speedy. Limbs get chopped off as you go. If you lose all 4 limbs, your vulnerable core can be hit and you can die. Monster function similarly, so you can sometimes run into some strange creatures like rats with bear legs and the like. The game is powered by rot.js and runs in your browser, so it is super easy to try out. There is not enough content to keep you playing for more than a few minuites, but since it is so easy to run, I'd say its worth a spin just to see the interesting mechanic.\n    This is a game about losing limbs and attaching new ones, in any unholy manner you see fit. The limb system probably could of been developped a bit more for this game to really work. You lose limbs in battle and you can aquire new ones by defeating enemies. It was a little hard to determine what effect different creature limbs did but I think I noticed a speed difference with some limbs. One game I had a dog leg and a rat leg and nothing could chase me down. However lose of limbs also seemed to have no or little noticable effect on the player. I still managed to run away from a kobold whilst having no legs (or arms for that matter). Weapons (and shields) can also be found in the dungeon but only found attached to lopped off limbs. These items are apparently cursed and stay with the limb. One time I had two shields and found myself unhittable; funnily enough I could still lob of limbs though. Love the name of the game, it really sums it up..\n    Interesting experiment - you can attach lost limbs with other limbs found in the dungeon. Too bad actual implementation is way too shallow. There is a little bit of challenge on first levels, until you find a few powerful arms. Then you can complete thr set of most powerful arms and rely on luck after that."

But I don't know if it is possible to achieve the bad ending since the game crashed soon after I turned into 'z'. While you are a zombie your control of movement is approximate, and you automatically attack nearby humans. This is somewhat inconsistent with how zombies chase you by moving perfectly straight. It would be nice to have the police station building where you always find some weapon and ammo. Having to run around the whole map to collect them is tedious. As well as it could be nice to have a siren or a hooter to attract remaning zombies. Anyway it is really great game for a first roguelike.\n    Yet another zombie game but a solid entry in the competition. Difficult and a bit frustrating as you begin empty-handed and must try to find weapons and resources all while being pursued by zombies. Once you do find weapons it's satisfying to kill zombies but you run out of ammo quickly. Most games are short as a result. Some clever ideas like other human survivors on the map with you and a running count of the human-to-zombie ratio.\n    A zombie apocalypse game.

Given the top of the line amazing artwork, there is huge potential here, and for all the other developers I strongly recommend a look to see what majestic things can be done for the top end of looks for roguelikes. Sadly there isn't much going on below the shiny surface. Also, while some people may not care - sexism in the gaming industry is a real actual problem, and pushing it beyond the all too common scantily clads right into upskirt shot territory is just tasteless. I hope that the devs don't continue down that road for their protagonist.\n    Pretty much the textbook example of style over substance.  Beautiful artwork and a high degree of aesthetic polish, but this seems to have been at the expense of any real gameplay to speak of.  Indeed, the whole package comes across feeling rather corporate and soulless, not helped by the trying-too-hard humour which undercuts rather than enhances the game's personality.  That said, there is a firm technical and graphical base for a larger game here - which given the fact that the game refers to itself as a 'demo' I assume is on the way."

Probably survival game should focus more on gaining food, and probably eating strange stuff. Food in this game doesn't even have a name. It's generic food. It's especially sad because the game looks pretty nice and have it own fun aspects.\n    Dungeon-Themed Starvation Simulator is a quest in food management.

    "st": "2 - Good variety of items.  Random dungeon layout is well done.  A solid round of bugfixes would get the game up to a 3.  I get the feeling the author was trying to do too much, and didn't have time for a debugging pass.\n    2 - Hard to judge, since I couldn't get off the first level - perhaps there is masses more content hidden away on level 2.  From what I could play it seems like the implemented scope is nowhere near as big as the intended scope, but there's already a fairly largish selection of items in place.",
    "rt": "3 - Random dungeon, monsters, and items in a fantasy setting.\n    3 - Definitely.",
    "reviewText": "I consistently got the feeling that there's a great game in there, if only I can get to it.  The companion mechanic is really out-of-sight, and the items have a good amount of variety.  But the bugs and the interface/control quirks get in the way of the experience.  Work on the bugs, regularize the controls (consider asking some people you know to give you feedback while they're playing?), and make the graphics feel like your own, and you've got a solid game.\n    Due to it consistently crashing when I tried to go down to level 2 I had to base this review on just playing the first level a couple of times over, so hopefully that is representative of the game as a whole.  It has the makings of a fun roguelike, but it seems to me like the author tried to do a bit more than the time available permitted and as a result the game in its current state is very unstable, unbalanced and unfinished."

The limited pistol ammo also gives it some small element of strategy in deciding when to rely on fists over lead.

Simple enemies, a few items, a place for messages, etc. It's a roguelike.\n    2 - The game is somewhat roguelike with a different weapon mechanic, but the levels are static.\n    1 - While it uses a roguelike engine and shows some inspiration from roguelikes, the levels are pre-made and the gameplay is story driven, so not a roguelike.",
    "reviewText": "Oh those crazy dames! Find out who killed your detective coworkers, run through some seriously thung filled sewers, infiltrate the crime boss's house, and save the girl in the red dress. And do it all with nothing more than your six shooter and a few grenades you find along the way. A simple game with good storytelling.\n    The game at least has a little back story, and some of the dialog in the game indicates the developer at least spent some of their time trying to explain the circumstances the character finds themselves. The aiming mechanism for the pistol is nice, especially with the FOV calculations included to add *some* realistic physics to the gameplay. The game restore feature should have saved the player's current position, instead of starting the all the way back at the beginning, though that might have been an oversight. The enemies are quite basic, nothing special.\n    A neat little story-driven game with a noir setting.  I enjoyed it but as the levels are all pre-designed and the overall design sensibility is rather 'mainstream' I'm not sure it really meets the criteria of being a roguelike.  That aside, it's rather a pleasant experience.  The story is evocative though fairly derivative and contributes to a surprisingly exciting final level, although the gameplay itself doesn't have a huge amount of challenge or depth."

It lacks any sort of resource managment. Note that this sort of game doesn't really need resource management, but to get the perfect '3' I like to see that or at least one other classic element.",
    "reviewText": "You wake up home alone and hope for the house layout to be correctly generated. The front door is locked so you find a door into a magic corridor, survive a horrible critter into a corridor of Doom just to unlock the front door and escape.\n    This is a nice little horror game with limited elements and a basic control scheme. It's pretty creepy, utilizing sound and darkness to create that hint of fear required for a good horror game. This game does not score a lot higher because there are just so few elements. For what it is though it's pretty approachable. It confuses you about what to do for the first few minutes, but that seems purposeful. Just use spacebar and arrows to move around, you'll figure it all out and have a bit of scary fun doing it."

You have to collect enough weapon and armour upgrades to let you face up to it. This is pretty neatly done, and at the start of the game in particular there's a nice tense atmosphere as you wonder whether or not the creature is round the corner waiting to eviscerate you. However with perfect play it's very easy, and lacks procedural levels to make it engaging for replays.\n    A very small scifi roguelike that tries to raise tension as you wander an empty spaceship, stalked by a dark creature, and... oddly, kind of succeeds, really, or at least did in my case. The creature appears as just an empty tile, which means that the best way to spot it is to actually watch the list of allowed actions for \"stun creature\" to appear. Winning was quite easy - lock the creature in a room, go pick up stuff, come back and kill it while stunlocked - and there needs to be more game before it would be possible to \"balance\" it to be more challenging.\n    A very simple roguelike, where you gather powerups and have to defeat one enemy, who is initially stronger than you. I have won after several tries."

It is a tile grid rendered in ascii, but that's not quite enough here for a 3.",
    "reviewText": "In this game you have to traverse big labyrinth, aggravate guards of labyrinth so they fight each other, get keys from dead guards to open gate(s) that protect exit. Each next level have more gates and more guards. But labyrinth is damn big. I've spent a lot of time just reaching first guard to practice confusion technique mentioned in instructions. I'd say the game is too tedious. You spend too much time mindlessly pressing keys.\n    It crosses a puzzle game with a roguelike, resulting in a game that's fun for a bit but becomes tedious after a few plays. Mazes are long and complex and you're often backtracking through them, which gets annoying. There's a lack of variety having only one kind of monster and only a single way of killing them, making the boredom come creeping in pretty quickly.\n    This is another nice entry into the burgeoning procedural puzzle subgenre. It focuses more on positioning than on resource management or loot chasing. There isn't a ton here but I recommend a quick look to everyone. It has some interesting mechanics and is easy to pick up and just play. With so many games in the competition this year it's refreshing to play a game that doesn't require a huge commitment to learn. So give it a quick run through, if anything the run away and set the guards off on each other gameplay can and should be folded into other larger games."

You bump a bunch of monsters with a character that has no discernable way to improve. You chug lots of health potions as you fight, but the interface for doing so is awkward (requiring multiple mouse clicks while using the keyboard to keep fighting in real time). The multiplayer aspect isn't really all that exciting in my opinion as it would just mean you do the same thing as before, but chug health pots less often. With more content though this game could be a really nice starting place for an awesome game.\n    A try at creating yet another multiplayer roguelike. It works but does not have anything to offer as a game.\n    It's a nice, simple little dungeon crawler you can adventure through with whoever turns out to be playing at the same time, which is neat.  No levelling, no abilities and no items except potions limits its longevity, but an attractive layout helps it become an enjoyable experience for fifteen minutes or so."

Unfortunately the dungeon feels linear and the combat tedious, detracting from an intriguing storyline.\n    Uses the Zelda-clone model (similar to Binding of Isaac) to tell a silly and rather surreal story.

    "rt": "1 - It's real time and the default game is played in a static galaxy.\n    2 - Procedural generation and permadeath. But more of a shooter like the original Elite than a RL.\n    1 - It's 2D Elite, minus some features and in ASCII. Only a roguelike in terms of being ASCII, really, and in the sense that Elite had permadeath as well.",
    "reviewText": "This game looks very good, and the UI is well designed to give you lots of information. However, you seem to be forced to buy a scoop immediately in order to progress, and progress is slow because trading doesn't seem to work. The game(i.e. flying and fighting) is still fun to play around with, and this game would turn into a really cool spaceship game with a little more content.\n    Elite RL is an interesting attempt that seems to have suffered a bit from over overreach. Like its namesake you play as a merchant/warrior traveling the galaxy trying to make a profit while trying to avoid smasking your ship into space stations. The good looks and plays well, but suffers from lack of depth. Trading is present, but all stations have the same prices. Combat is present, but all enemies are more or less the same. This is definitely a title that could use some more development and I would look forward to playing it some day.\n    It calls itself Elite RL and it means it - a lovely implementation of the feel of Elite in a 2d ASCII game. That said, non-Elite-players are likely to be even more baffled by the controls than I was, and there's no explanation for anything. Trading and exploring starts to feel a bit hollow once you realise how little variation there is as well."

The funhouse setting brings some fresh and interesting ideas though, and come on, everybody loves to bash clowns.\n    While I like the game's aesthetics, the lack of eneny varieties leads to very rapid boredom. Obviously I would have liked to see the usage of the other character stats such as Imagination (as a weapon?) and Breathe (a stamina-like stat?), I think that would make the game much more interesting.\n    FunhouseRL has a great premise; about time someone made a roguelike about a Pink song but it just does not have enough content. There is no where enough variation in the game to keep it entertaining. That said the atmosphere really works as would be its strong point if developed further. The player statistics were not really developed well, I still dont know what imagination does, presumably you hold you breath when attacking and self-confidence was obviously hitpoints. Levelling up seemed to do nothing. All in all a great start to a game that I hope will be turned into a complete game at some later stage."

The theme is actually well done, you have a random executable name, you start off as version 1.0 and try to level, i.e. upgrade versions. Very cute. You go around \"derazzing\" other malicious software entities until you eventually find the i/o tower to re-establish contact with your User. The game is quite well done technically, has clean interface, autosaves your progress and easy to follow help. However the gameplay is a little bland, and the use of the vi keys as the only way to move you program around was a big mistake. Presumably this was done to add to the theme, but it makes the game hard to get into, the addition of auto-explore and auto-stair find was essential to a usually non-vi player. I really wanted to find some way of in game hacking to enable numkey access.  The game has promise but lacking scope/content. The corruption effects on the game screen were a novel addition.\n    This is a really good game for getting an idea of the kind of visual aesthetics you can get while still using ASCII (actually UTF) characters. The descriptions of events and the leveling process really support the theme without being uncomfortably foreing to a roguelike game.\n    This is not a Discworld game, but a game where you are a program who wants to defeat all the malware on the disk and be executed by the user (does not make much sense, but that's not the point). It has quite nice graphical elements, but it is annoying that it supports only the VI keys. Unfortunately, it becomes boring quickly."

    "reviewText": "Does the (now fairly common) pixely 8-bit retro type thing that I feel I've seen a lot these days. It's colorful and cute and has nice creepy music playing the whole time. Classic NES-era feel. Very twitchy gameplay which is crippled by terribly slow, non-reactive controls, sucking all the fun out and replacing it with frustration. Endless enemies also just adds to the frustration. Might have been more fun if it used turn-based combat.\n    I am unsure if this developer want this game to be considered finished. Unless I'm somehow missing something, there's a bug that forces the player to fly several spaces instead of moving just one space per click. If that could get cleaned up then this game is pretty neat. You play a little mechanic or robot guy on a space ship. Your goal, I think, is to get all the bodies on the ship flushed out the air lock. Each body emits ghosts like the old Gauntlet game, so you need to get that body off the ship before you are overwhelmed. Your robot has 4 way shooting but with limited ammo, he also has a wrench he can use to whack ghosts. Ghosts hate both bullets and wrenches. You can also blow up barrels and cause a nice bit of AoE chaos. There's also a bunch of goodie crates stacked around you can bust open for space bucks, healthy packs and ammo. I hope this developer finishes this little game, it could be pretty fun."

Main drawback at present is that enemies are too stupid to present much of a challenge and the gameplay systems are a little too predictable once you've figured them out - there is little to surprise you and the chief danger of dying becomes simply getting bored and not paying enough attention.  These faults could be corrected without much effort, however, and this could form the basis of a pretty good roguelike in future."

Somehow they know not to step beside you in the dark when you wait, which really thwarts the feeling of ambushing people.  This results in painful times when you are passing turns hoping for the enemy to wander out, but their motion doesn't seem random enough to gamble on, or controlable enough to control them.  This really needs stupider enemies.  Some almost seem to patrol, for example, but as soon as you move into a place on their patrol route to catch them?  They stop moving there.\n    2 - It is nice at first, but the game lacks meaningful choices.

Invincible in the dark. But when there is no way to lure the enemy from an illuminated area, all these ninja trick do not have any sense. Also the game can generate level entrance in the middle of an illuminated area with couple of enemies around. 'Normal' ninja could use the smoke bomb to conceal himself, but not in this game.

Perhaps there is an ending but I did not find it. The game levels are basic, a few rooms and doors with a few random items and monsters thrown in for good measure. All monsters seemed the same to me, except for that 'E' that just randomly moved around. Items have durability as their only stat as far as could tell anyway. It did not really make a difference what you chose. With instant use potions as the only real way of healing, I found it nearly impossible to progress without been caught in the open. Secret passageways were a good way to escape monsters but they seemed to really delay the inevitable, as monsters just skirted around obstacles and caught you anyway. Promising start but needs to gameplay twists to become a better game.\n      This game took awhile to get playable and I'm glad it finally did. This is a straight old school style Roguelike with a stripped down interface. No need to worry too much about inventory management and what not, you bump an item and pick it up and/or drink it. Simple and easy. There can be some strange lag between input and player movement, I'm not sure if it's a field of view issue or if the program is getting caught upon the enemy behavior routines. Could be either. This doesn't make the game unplayable but it's definitely an issue. If you want to check out a straight up dungeon dive without much fuss, check out Unhappy Devil."

I loved the names and descriptions as you encounter new monsters and stumble upon dead companions.\n    Ok so you are an aspiring author in search of inspiration, which comes in the form of weird named multi-coloured monsters. And there is plenty to be found. This game really gave off an Adom vibe with Infra Arcana overtones, which I might add is not a bad thing. It seems that the idea of the game could have been explored further, there is an insanity system that eventually means you can not descend further and affects your score, your light requires batteries or your plunged into darkness. But these features just did not really bring anything to the game. Upgraded guns seem to just have larger capacity with no other effects. All up a solid start that with a bit more effort could turn into a decent game."

It's not really clear what the chances of getting bit are, but if you don't have something better than a broom you're screwed anyway. The very tightly and short directional FOV makes it much harder than it should be. Being able to look any direction for free makes it pointless to have directional FOV but it's boring enough to do that I rarely looked around much. It seemed like sneaking until you found the food and sprinting back was the only strategy that actually worked, unless two zombies randomly lined up and you couldn't dodge past them.\n    A pretty basic zombie survival game - Set in a city, you must venture forth each day to find food. That's pretty much it. Nice tiles and sounds but there's not a lot of depth in the gameplay. It can be fun for a while running around chainsawing zombies but there isn't much to keep you involved.\n    Run from zombies and try to collect enough food to survive one more day. If this game had keyboard controls I would recommend it, but as-is, the graphics are a bit harsh and the gameplay is very shallow. Sounds and music are nice though!"

    "ft": "2 - Like real fishing this does require patience. Little variety between games and low challenge both restrict replayability. It is quite cool when first playing though - the game has charm. And if you avoid resting it suddenly has some fun challenge.\n    1 - Just felt like a slot machine. Sometimes a fish deigns to move onto the correct square and get hooked, sometimes a hooked fish deigns to move closer to you, sometimes a caught fish lets you go to the next level.\n    2 - Just like when you really go fishing, you might have to wait forever for a fish to bite. This grew tedious as there was no real challenge to it, just sit and wait...and wait...and wait. Also the challenge was a bit off because you can rest up fully by just waiting. Still I'm giving it a 2 because it had that little indescribable quality that makes me giggle, \"I got one!\"",

Overall game short and linear.\n    1 - Random levels, but without any real impact on gameplay.\n    2 - There is procedural content and permadeath here, but it is not integral to play. That's not a bad thing really. I don't think a game like this really needs it to be integral.",
    "reviewText": "Turn-based procedural fishing with a central resource that acts as health, stamina and food clock (it constantly decreases). However since you can rest all you want to increase stamina the game lacks challenge - you can just scum the spacebar key. It's much more fun if you ban yourself from using this. The fishing controls work well, and though there aren't many enemies they do all have intersting features.\n    A neat idea, but I didn't feel there were any decisions to be made. You catch fish until you're allowed to go to the next level. Perhaps with some kind of resource management (a limited supply of alternative lures, other objects salvageable from fish, etc.) I might have felt more engaged. Keys were often unresponsive when the line was cast - there seem to be some hidden rules about where the bobber can be moved.\n      So this was a fun little fishing game I recommend to everyone for a bit of diversion. There isn't a ton of depth here, but if anyone is going to make a fishing Roguelike in the future this one will be the prototype. The enemies that exist are nice and varied and the controls work just fine. It is a testament to the quality of the game that this reviewer wants more more more!"

You can lower your FOV and keep a manual count of your potions, and choose not to skip levels... but ultimately you can either hold down x for an instant win, or walk straight past monsters since they dont hurt you unless you attack them. Not attacking enemies will hurt you in the long run though because you will need to engage the boss at the end to win, and the only way to level up is wiping out a floor. All of the nessecities are there for a solid game, but unfortunately there isnt quite enough polish to round it out properly.\n    This is your basic roguelike game, and were it not for the bug with the unlimited usage of the health potions, it might actually be quite challenging. However without a variety of items, the game rapidly loses its replay value. The ability to regenerate a level when the algorithm produces an unwinnable scenario is a nice touch, though some of those issues could be avoided if the creatures could walk over chests and the staircase.\n    This is a nice straight forward dungeon dive. You can adjust the field of view, and this keeps the game fairly tense. You make the choice each level to slaughter all the bad guys and level up, to sprint for the exit and move on and/or explore the level for some potions. The fatal flaw in this game, which kills it almost dead, is that the player seems to have infinite potions. My potion count never counted down and I was able to just heal on a whim whenever. So you are basically able to windshield the entire game. Fix that little issue and this is a solid entry into this years challenge."

It's random and unforgiving. Getting past the first level is an accomplishment actually.\n    It is an interesting concept, the fleeing for your life part of a RL as a full game -- but it felt a little too random (and not enough procedural) for my taste.

Realtime twitch combat COULD have a place in an innovative roguelike (see: binding of isaac), but the game would need a lot more polish to showcase that.",
    "st": "1 - Very limited. No items, 1 enemy. There is no variety between levels (not counting empty levels).\n    2 - Beyond mutators, is very straightforward\n    2 - About what I'd expect for a 7DRL.",
    "rt": "2 - Not really a roguelike, it has a random map and standard turn-based movement.\n    2 - Roguelike\n    2 - 1.5 rounded up. Real time element really detracts from roguelike-ness (implementation feels un-roguelikey as opposed to innovative). But other roguelike systems are there just fine.",
    "reviewText": "As a rogue of the dashing space kind, you are tasked to take out enemy ships single-handedly (you wouldn't want it any other way now, would you?). Filled with pixelated/retro goodness you move around in a spaceship killing badies and initiating self destruct sequences before jumping to the next ship. The graphics are cool especially the interior cutaway effect from the outside of the ship.  However the gameplay is lacking as you really just move, occasionally shoot and go to the next level. Enemies are predicable and need more variety. The ship interior is also a bit lacklustre. There are some different options/upgrades to choose at the start of each game, which have a noticable effect on the game, including more amour/ammo, health or ammo replenishing between levels, and speed effects. The slow enemy ammo upgrade was perhaps a little too powerful though. A solid effort in seven days but needs a bit more content.\n.\n    It isn't as simple as it seems at first glance. It tooks me several rounds to realize that the AI would actually group up and move with me if I tried to run. However, I found the shooting/avoiding mechanic frustrating: if I shot at an enemy, I would get hit in return. That meant for quick sessions where I would ponder the mutators (less ammo, more health, or movement constraints) and then die very quickly. I liked the graphics though, but the random layouts would sometimes produce edges that appeared inconsistent and it meant their visual positioning left me wondering as to their purpose.\n    Board ships and shoot robots with hyper-lasma (relitivistic combination of laser and plasma). This game starts off with a hilarious menu-based skill selection system. Twitch real-time shooting does not feel very roguelikey but the game itself has cheek and some endearing graphics.  Levels feel very empty though."

Hint: after you fire a rocket you have to move or a bug causes it to blow up immediately, killing you.\n    Presumably endless levels of the same objective per level; shop as much as possible without getting killed or shopblocked by other shoppers lest the monsters get you. If you're lucky, your rockets fire and not miss them. Otherwise, you can always shop again. And again. And again. Please come again tomorrow, we love you. It would have been nice if there was a highscore table or just some feedback so I knew if I played better or worse the next try.\n    A fairly typical monster-maze game. You don't have hit points, so getting touched by a monster is game-over. Imagine a turn-based Pac-Man with sparse, randomly placed dots and fruit and you get the basic idea behind this game. Well, if Pac-Man could shoot exploding rockets. There's just not quite enough to the game to give you any strategy other than running away from monsters and hoping you stumble upon the odd bit of money."

Each level is a single box room with a selection of enemies, items, a portal down and maybe a portal to the final boss. The final boss runs away from you constantly, and combined with the mouse interface over tiny tiles - it is the most annoying fight ever. Its impossible to power up effectively if you choose to dive because you will have no idea whether the thing you just picked up is better or worse than the last thing. There are no abilities, and the ambient energy that is hinted as being a core unique feature appears to have no effect on gameplay that I could work out.\n    I have a large amount of issues with this one, namely that on death, any keypress exits the game. It's very confusing at first. The graphics are good, but the messages on the playing area disrupt things visually and are rather distracting. It seems like it could be a good game, but lack of UI clarity ruins it quite a bit.\n    You hack your way through rooms teleporting between them. After you acquire a decent weapon (sword or saber) and cold or freezing soul you may take blue teleport to Marquis' throne room. Then, you hope not to get instantly slain by random number generator's whim while pounding De Sade into a pulp. Try freezing and burning system. It is the only innovative thing in this game but it alone does not make it worth checking out for me."

Aside from that and my maximum HP increasing, there wasn't much change between levels: a few tougher monsters, and that's it.  At one point I found a spear that seemed to increase my damage, but otherwise the loot just increments a counter, and I'm not sure what I'm working toward there.  The lack of a goal or motivation is really the only issue I didn't cover in the rest of my review.  (And it doesn't take much to motivate me, either: I spent a few hours once building a gigantic glass tower in Minecraft, just because I had a lot of spare sand.)  Some kind of progression, in character, environment, or both, would go a long way toward holding the player's attention.  I liked the graphics and the music, and not just because they're well beyond what I can do.  Just a bit more complexity and change would make it much easier to play for longer.\n    A good base for a 8bit hack and slash. As always with 7DRL, lacks a bit variety and depth but this could be added later.\n    This is a pretty looking webgame where you point and click your way through dungeon levels. There is a some good content and difficulty curve for a few levels, but it just never ends. Perhaps that's what the title is all about. There are a couple of unfortunate bugs and movement quirks but all in all it's a solid effort."

Or not - it's hard to figure out, because the interface is fairly poor at giving you feedback about whether it's doing what you asked or not. The game consists of one prebuilt outdoor level and two dungeon levels. The first dungeon level is either generated quite well (I've liked the shapes it has taken so far) or chosen from a pregenerated set - I don't know for sure - while the second one is always a gauntlet run that I think is predesigned.\n    Han Yolo is an ambitious 3D game that just didn't pan out. It seems like a good concept, but the lack of variety and unresponsive controls make this one hard to get into. This is a Unity game played in a browser, if your connection is slow it will take awhile to load up. You also may need a pretty good video card to run it.

Not that that's a bad thing, and I can see how a fledgling developer would struggle with implementing basic roguelike features. I really don't want to belittle the effort that has gone into this game. But all in all, it has no reason to stand out from the mass for players.\n    It's a good first attempt. Balance is far from perfect, but even experienced developers are having troubles with balance, especially in 7drl."

I think some cards in this game are much more useful than other, and you can easily end up with more or less useless deck and no way to renew it. The ballance of the game is completely off. Or at least it feels this way. Sometimes you don't really know what killed you.\n    This game has a lot of interesting ideas both gameplay-wise with its card-based magic system and thematically with its dream-based setting.  However it fails to really take advantage of either to the fullest.  Despite the infinite possibilities afforded by the dream-theme the whole game seems to take place in a school setting and the card system in effect only acts to limit your actions to a semi-random selection.  The game is at first confusing but intriguing, yet sadly there doesn't seem to be much to discover underneath that."

Its very simple, but the graphics are slick and simple as well, and it all blends into an almost minimalist art piece. Sadly, the game seems rather unbalanced since finding a weapon will see you cruising, and the random boss encounter (if it is that and not just a hard enemy), likely even on the first floor, will never ever end well (haha). That aside, if the author just fixes the controls, then this game has real potential.\n    A console RPG style menu-based crawler where you fight evil cultists in modern day.

    "reviewText": "A time sliced game where you control a spaceship racing to the warp gate to the next area. Each 'turn' you use the mouse to drag the direction and distance (within limits) you wish to travel, and release the pause to progress through the game a bit. Despite being upgradable those limits can be a bit too restrictive, and often leave little room for maneuverability despite the unexplained free teleports when you get close to enemies. I feel like the core mechanic is solid, but the ship either has be stronger than ricepaper for effective combat, or more engaging to dodge around. \n    A simultaneous turn-based 2d space flying game where on each turn you set your movement plan for the next second or so. Play by dragging the movement arrow around and pressing space, and by clicking the icons on the bottom right. The author makes it clear that it's about escaping the ships attacking you, not killing them, so pick your heading vectors away from stuff that's trying to kill you. There's a very odd mechanic where when enemy ships close in to you the first time on a given level, you sometimes get to \"resolve your position\" - i.e. teleport within a small circle. I guess that can be useful for dodging shots, but it'll be interesting to hear if it has an in-universe explanation. \n    The premise is ok, nothing out of the ordinary but solid. You escape through space, hunted by the law for a crime you claim you did not commit. Your punishment; death. Original? No, but who cares if the game holds it own. It has some good qualities, but for a graphical game it simply does not shine. The ship movement, while quite cool (you drag a bendy arrow around to represent you next trajectory) would of worked better if the distance of space combat was scaled better e.g. slow incoming missiles vs ship inertia. (maybe I am swayed by Jack Cambell's Lost Fleet novels here). However the action takes place quickly and subtle ship movements get lost in the action. Combat is a little lack luster, where you really just look to escape each sector and there is no reason to take any risks in doing so."

    "ct": "2 - This game looks like it borrows on previously developed code, as the apparent depth of the game seems enormous. However this game is very pre-release quality. Bugs run rampant, I found myself stuck in walls more often that I would have liked! One time an empty level was generated and I died before I got out of the elevator. There is plenty of menu choices, six characters to choose from with differing sets of skills. Lacking polish? Definitely!\n    1 - Lots of buttons with empty functionality. Major bugs.\n    2 - Basic gameplay is there, but it's missing bits. Didn't find instructions for how to actually play it.",
    "at": "3 - This game goes for a Russian commie feel and does it quite well. Everything seems themed towards this idea, and given it is a graphical game it has plenty of commie eye candy to throw at you. Not to mention the inspirational background music that just makes you want to give your all for you state or die trying. In game graphics sometimes felt a little rushed and the enemies were weird looking but it all seems to work.\n    1 - Play pretty much requires remapping the controls, and you often fall into things you cannot see because the view does not keep up with your player.\n    2 - Fun Soviet stylings, but gets kinda grating in places. Had to silence the music. Graphics are a weird mix of crisp Unity engine 3D and notebook scribble monsters.",
    "ft": "2 - This is a hard one, the game is incomplete and buggy so that detracts a bit, but there is definitely some fun to be had. Some of the skills are a blast, like super jump and levitate block (these can also end you game in a buggy fashion though). Combat is difficult though as is navigation through the levels.\n    1 - It seems like it could be pretty fun if it were a more complete game. You have lots of character classes to choose from. Seems some sort of upgrade scheme was planned.\n    1 - Not really there. The platformer physics are wonky and unpleasant. You seem to need the tile levitation spell to navigate the map, and since it uses the physics engine it can get you stuck if you use it in tight corners",
    "it": "2 - A procedurally generated real-time side-view platformmer is kind of unique for a roguelike. Now is probably not the time to mention Spelunky.  Playing for the red team is cool. \n    2 - Realtime platformers have been done before, but the Russian theme here was pretty neat as well as all of the character classes.\n    2 - I suppose a Soviet-themed procedural platformer is somewhat innovative.",
    "st": "2 - Everything except the play dungeon is quite expansive. The dungeon lets you down it is simple and quite boring.  There are no items or dungeon features other than lava. There are some unique enemies but not many. Starting a game is good, plenty of menu options and character classes. There are a handful of unique skills in the game as well.\n    1 - Had this game been finished the scope would have been massive, as is there's not much working here.\n    2 - Pretty media-heavy for a 7DRL. Multiple classes, probably should have focused on making the gameplay work with just one.",
    "rt": "2 - Has enough roguelike elements to scrape a 2; perma-death, random dungeons, player classes and skills.\n    1 - Seems like the levels are procedrually generated, but not much else to make it part of the genre. That's not a bad thing, but still it gets a 1.\n    1 - Nah. It's going for a Spelunky-style platformer-roguelike, but the physics engine turns everything into random flailing, there's no sense of needing gameplay skill here.",
    "reviewText": "You have been volunteered into the dungeon exploration team which of course is a privilege for any hard-working communist. This game is quite simply a Soviet Union themed procedurally-generated real-time side-scrolling platformer game, well ok maybe not so simple. The game initially comes across as a bigger game, with it graphics, menu system, key customisation, many classes, in game themed descriptions etc etc, but is let down by the dungeon exploration (the actual game). The dungeon is hard to navigate and you really don’t see enough of it to choose your path wisely. A look down command would of saved me a lot of times from the inevitable fall into lava. The game itself is quite buggy and some of the skills can instantly end your game in a not so friendly way. E.g getting stuck in rock, or jumping through the outer walls of the playable dungeon (super jump). However some of the skills are quite cool, like block levitate, here you can see some of the game physics at work as once you let the block go it can fall and rotate and land at an angle. (that is assuming the physics wont jam you head first into a rock. All said and done this game obviously has a lot of promise but needs to address some of the major issues first. \n    This game is a pretty ambitious undertaking, unfortunately there were just a ton of problems with it. Missing features, bugs, view issues, getting stuck, etc...Had it been completed it would have been vast and crazy good, but I'm not sure it could have been finished in the 7 days alloted. So in the end this was a good effort, but probably just ended up too big to finish.\n    A Soviet Union themed platform game, one of those Unity engine games. Had to go to the config screen to figure out the controls. Actual gameplay is platforming in a hard to navigate sideways block maze. The character controls feel unpleasant, with floaty, weightless movements. There's physics everywhere making things a chaotic mess. Didn't get a sense of gameplay out of this."

However, it omits many of the creative features of roguelikes such as equipment, wands, varied monsters, hidden features and randomly generated maps.",
    "reviewText": "This is a relatively simple web-based game.  Feels a little basic at the moment, and needs a bit of work on the control system to make movement a bit smoother, but could be a good base for further development.\n    Really there's just not much here. It doesn't score too badly though because the interface is tight and the building blocks for a terrific roguelike are all here. With some more time maybe this author can make something great. With procedural generation and more content this one could have been very good.\n    An exercise in producing a traditional roguelike, this game would have looked at home on the free demo floppies that come with computer game magazines in the early 90s; an effort has been made to make this roguelike technically \"correct\", but no attempt has been made to add any sort of depth or replay value; this is the sort of game that would fit better in a one-day roguelike challenge.  In seven days you'd expect a little more content, depth or creativity - as it is, it just feels like a tech demo for a very primitive engine.  This game could be rescued if it were given a dozen more levels, a dozen more monsters, and some interesting inventory items, and there's nothing wrong with it on a technical level - it's just too unambitious to score well."

Having more ways to interect with what's going on would be nice too.\n    Here's a hacking simulation (not a roguelike) where you compete against AI players. You create objects with different functions like detection or attack, and then your objects might interact with the AI objects. Could be the beginnings of a larger strategy game.

Hope to see more from this in the future!\n    This describes itself as an attempt at a \"Portal/Antichamber-like logic-puzzle game\". The Portal reference would be more reasonable if there actually were any portals. However, there are lasers, and pushable mirror and opaque cubes, and blue stuff that causes repulsion, so at least the author has played Portal.

Currently too short scoped to be really interesting, but with a solid engine and a classic but functionnal UI, it could be a good base for a better entry next year.\n      This is a pretty basic game requiring a ton of grinding to be successful. Getting through the entire game to get the amulet requires going back and forth between levels bumping monsters until the player has enough hit points to move on.

    "reviewText": "You need to direct hyperquark beam into antiplasma node in 30 seconds by setting it's route with mirrors. You move mirrors by pushing them. The level is hexagonal. The biggest problem is that you can only push mirrors. No pulling or picking. If required mirror is generated next to wall, you are doomed. The keys do not repeat, you can press and hold the key to run in given direction. Including realtime nature of the game it is serious flaw. It could be a nice minigame withing bigger game (if made properly and better turnbased)."

    "reviewText": "A dungeon crawler where you can see further than enemies and sneak up on them to cause more damage from behind. Visually it's very polished, but the gameplay is sadly lacking in many areas. Enemies have no variety, there is some progression through item games but it's random, and the levels are very slow to explore with little content to keep one engaged. Would love to see more with this visual style though.\n    The author calls T.H.A.D. a \"playable tech demo\" on his site, and it's hard to argue with that.  However, I wouldn't go as far as he does in calling it a \"failure\".  The game shows off some very nice stealth-based gameplay.  Enemies turn in place as they stand guard, and the only way to kill them without taking significant damage is to sneak up from behind them.  A very nice real-time lighting engine cloaks most of the map in shadow and gives the game a horror feel, although it feels like you are the predator in this game, not the prey.  It's clear that unfortunately the author didn't get any time to put more than a handful of content in the game - there are only two monsters that I saw, and a few weapons and items that aren't very interesting.  Still, there is definitely potential here for a very good game.\n    Quoting the website: \"Now its not much of a game, but more of a playable tech demo. As a game contest, this is definitely a failure, but a playable one ;-).\""

    "reviewText": "Firing your weapon and getting hit by an enemy both cost you energy, so you must collect extra energy at the right time. This game isn't a roguelike, but as the core of a retro action arcade game it's fine.\n    Fun but only for a few minutes due to a lack of victory conditions. Life and ammo are the same, meaning you can kill yourself by shooting your gun too many times. Oxygen is always running out but can be replenished if you find a second tank of oxygen. The aliens seem able to pass through walls and shoot through them too. They can also shoot at diagonals, while you can only shoot in the four cardinal directions. Overall, incomplete and too simple to warrant more than 10 or 15 minutes of playtime.\n    Though this game does not score too highly it's actually a fun little diversion. It's a shooter where the player needs to manage his ammo/life battery and his oxygen. Kill all the bad guys before they kill you or you run out of air. Pick up more ammo/life and air as you run around killing everything. You figure out everything in the first 30 seconds, and beat it shortly thereafter. Not a bad game, just not really that roguelike. Making a bug free shooter like this is actually much more difficult than people think. So all in all a successful, if not too deep, 7DRL entry."

It was sometimes a little frustrating trying to figure out how to do what I already knew was the answer, but all the pieces of the puzzle are hidden in there waiting to be discovered and it felt good to figure them all out.\n    2 - Trying to figure out the hacking commands is really cool, I'm sure a lot of roguelike players would get a kick out of it. Unfortuantely getting the knowledge before dying is hard. Requires multiple playthroughs or do what I did and just hack the javascript.. seems appropriate!\n    1 - Not much to do here once you find out how to get around the guards. Finding some passwords required using a programming language outside the game.",

Wished there was a little more meat on the bones.\n    2 - A few levels to get through and NPCs to chat with. Each level introduces a new concept.",

This is a static content puzzle game, since combat is best avoided once you figure out how.\n    1 - Not really a roguelike except that there is a lot of dying.\n    1 - Turn-based puzzle with permadeath but static levels. Challenge comes from figuring out the rules of the scripting language, rather than tactics, strategy, or resource management.",
    "reviewText": "Trusty laptop by your side, you set forth on a prison break to free a fellow programmer. Friendly inmates will give you bits of syntax and the rest needs to be figured out for yourself. One of the first things you learn is connecting to objects in the level, and issuing commands to them - for example connecting to and turning on an elevator. Unfortunately there are only two types of object that can be interacted with in this way, and little gameplay beyond moving to the goal once you've worked out how activated/deactivated them. With work this game may be worth coming back to, but for now is sadly incomplete.\n    In rogue coder you literally have to code to survive. Meaning, you the player, not you the character. You need to learn the in-game scripting language to do stuff like unlock elevators and turn off lights. It's exceedingly hard to learn all of this though, so if I were you and you want to try this game just source-dive into the javascript and hack things that way. Seems only appropriate for a hacking roguelike!\n    Programming is outlawed, programmers are in jail, and you need to free a particular one on level 4. Armed with a laptop, you dodge guards, make friends with prisoners, and mess with elevator locks and room lights (provided you can figure out the sparsely-documented Dominicscript). Not much roguelike gameplay, but provides the kind of puzzling fun that the Python Challenge does. Probably not fun to play without programming experience."

Maps are fairly plain and nondescript. Enemies are only one type and just run toward you, shooting. You shoot back (no need to aim) and hope they die before you do. Rinse and repeat. Heal kits scattered around offer only +2 hit points, which is not enough to keep you alive for very long.\n    A simple turn-based shoot-em-up. Could use some variety and polish in just about everything, but certainly not a bad effort in seven days."

My little avatar kept running off the side of my phone. . He also cut though corners which is a little disconcerting watching something so small break the laws of physics. I actually did not mind the behaviour of using my finger to scroll the screen, it felt natural to me. But where is the pinch zoom in/out, I needed to see more of the map at times. My HP got messed up sometimes making it unreadable. Map scroll and player movement were not in synch. Suffers from run-time error crashes. \n    2 - Works, on an android device no less.  You slide through walls when you cut a corner in movement.  A bit sluggish to start on a Galaxy Nexus (4.1), and then slows to a crawl when \"home\" is reached.",
    "at": "1 - The terrain and character looked nice but little else did. Enemies are brightly coloured shaped, with no real identity. Your avatar actually had a cool icon so I would of like this to continue to the monsters as well. \n    1 - An open question for touch input is how to configure roguelikes for them.  This is not an answer.  Drag to scroll the map I feel is a bad thing to leave as your default behaviour.   Especially as there are little reason to scroll the maps.  Tap to move is cumbersome, and without path finding, painful to navigate L shaped corridors.  Combat is hence sloppy as you are uncertain if you are tapping at the right location.  The use of random rounded rectangles for enemies does not feel like a clever procedural enemy - it feels like placeholder art.  I don't know why ASCII wasn't used for all the tiles - this would have given a much cleaner look and allow for randomized enemies easier!  Java even supports fonts, so you could do all the rendering down to a bitmaps at runtime.",

Hacking coloured shapes is also not my idea of fun, enemies had no real identity. Perhaps on a larger device I might have enjoyed it more. I also regularly got run-time crashes. Best part was the inter-level messages.\n    2 - A very basic dungeon bash.

I did notice some were different, but I never really started to learn which ones had which behaviours.  This is where having different letters would give a more discrete levels of behaviour, so you could learn that 'a' acts in way 1 while 'b' acts in way 2.",
    "st": "1 - Not much here, a random dungeon, and random shapes. Bump to attack thats it.\n    1 - This is much more than an @ on a map, but it really needs some work on the combat mechanic to bring it to the 7drl level.",

This game seems more like a learning experience for the developer than a complete game, probably because it was. The game does not have much depth and controls are clunky. However with better enemies, tighter controls and perhaps a smaller easier to navigate map this game might of been something. The game does lack any gameplay features other than explore and bump into coloured objects. Would like to see this pushed further to see a classic roguelike on the android.\n    Alternate Dimension Rogue Like sees you tripping through a mysterious wasteland fighting glowing blobs of different hue.  Perhaps if you learn the pattern of these foes you can get your way safely home?  It is an Android based roguelike, but players may be disappointed in the touch controls being unfriendly."

If you're a fan I guess it might be amusing, but gameplay-wise it's just a fairly open tile map with monsters half of which can one- or two-shot you.

The controls work fine for what they are, it's easy to get stuck on walls though\n    2 - Graphics are functional. Controls are okay, but it's easy to accidentally click outside the window and end up with your game obscured by your browser window!

    "reviewText": "Set forth in a post-apocalyptic city, you must dodge zombies and enter buildings looking for a key. Once you've found it, you can leave the level through a locked door and be teleported to a boss fight. The boss fight is a single enemy with a combination of the two unique abilities that normal enemies have - Moving or shooting. Then you are teleported to a level that looks like the last to rinse and repeat. There is nothing to tie these things changes together, so you are in a building, then you are in an open space fighting a boss, then you are outside in a city again with no reasoning. Since it doesnt seem possible to replenish health, small mistakes will catch up to you later on and you may be killed simply by spawning too close to a zombie on one level. There is little variety, and interacting with the world is frustrating because you will often get briefly stuck against walls, and shooting stutters the view and moves you back a bit, meaning that you have to constantly fight the game to move as expected.\n    This is a fun diversion - you run around shooting zombies and mercs with your favourite gun, upgrading it Binding of Issac style until you have some uber streetsweeper of a weapon. The enemies and boss fights aren't much of a challenge and the most dangerous time is when you spawn in a new level - often times on top of a group of zombies. It's a serviceable topdown zombie shooter with some interesting gun upgrades, but it feels a little unfinished in terms of direction and content. \n    Move your character with WASD and aim with left click. Enemies are zombies that path towards you and soldiers that stand and fire at you - both are trivial to deal with. Play consist of one large level that has enemies constantly respawning. It looks like more was planned with this, but ultimately this failed to get anything roguelike-y into the game."

Essentially all you can do (so far as I could tell) is wander around a generated zoo looking at the animals.  Could be a nice setting for some kind of very non-traditional roguelike or even make a good educational tool if it provided some more information about the animals you were looking at, but as it is is little more than a tech demo for the generator.\n    Not a game so much as a program that creates a zoo in ASCII, with animals represented by letters standing around in their cages. Some environmental stuff (ice in the penguin cage) but not much else. Nothing to do but wander around looking at the animals. Game ends when you exit the zoo.\n    A great procedural zoo generator. Wander around a look at animals, but there is no real game here."

Having the moves processed server-side seems pointless and just slows the game down - I guess the author was trying to stick to technology with which he was familiar even though it was not really appropriate to the task.\n    The end product is obviously missing most of what was intended. It has the core beginnings of a roguelike though, in an interesting setting and with a little more experience could be fleshed out into an actual game. Scala/appspot was an interesting choice, probably one of the only roguelikes attempted with that. The web interface could really use some work, I'd suggest using jquery to submit player moves instead of doing a full reload."

No character growth either.",

If you want to get through it quickly, just hold the up key and you'll pass through trees and everything (although sometimes it takes a moment to pass through a tree).\n    An intersting concept that ends up being a bit too difficult to play to be fun for more than a few tries. The display is very tiny and the everything's the same color, making it difficult to distinguish enemies from friends. Aiming doesn't seem to work, making you fire randomly all around you and the controls are kind of sticky or non-responsive.\n    A roguelike based on the Vietnam War, in which you run around according to a fairly vague objective dying to things you can't really fight. Seems to be impossible to aim your attacks and enemies are equally poor at retaliating, so any attempt at combat is somewhat farcical.  Subject matter is a mite bit tasteless, too."

    "reviewText": "The Monastery Garden is a very incomplete feeling game where you interact with items and creatures. There are a multitude of interactions available, and clicking on an object will show you what you can do. Exploring this can hold some interest, but it soon becomes apparent that there just isn't much of a game here, and certainly little that resembles a roguelike.\n    This game is confounding. There seems like there may be depth here but there's just no apparent goal. From what I can tell it's not really a game. No winning, no losing, just waiting for the messages to pile up until the game glitches. It's possible the developer wanted to create a calming experience, more atmosphere than game. It's possible there's just something I'm not getting.\n    A game which suggests there was going to be much more to it. You can walk around, explore a (fixed) map and pick some items up, but other than that there's very little in this game. I managed to die of getting clubbed by a troll and once by eating a heart, and then watching post-death as objects decay has a degree of morbid interest, but there's not actually much here."

It's definitely not worth your time. My advice to the developer : using some roguelike tutorial might get you booted much faster with a solid base for your game including a good looking UI and a working console. Just google \"roguelike tutorial\".\n    This game is in very rough shape, but the core of a good idea would be fun if executed properly. Monochromatic, so enemies are hard to differentiate, and weird issues with the buffer/menu make it seem like the game is broken at first, thus, very hard to get into. Developer should take the idea and really focus on polishing up the mechanics and work on the colors/interface."

Enemies beeline for you until they hit a wall, standard roguelike traps require some visual acuity to avoid, and items can be picked up and used. There's potential for a game here, but at the moment it's not fun - new levels are often instant death, wall collisions interfere too much with steering, and steering must often be perfect to avoid traps or aim shots."

There is permadeath, randomly generated chests (either instakill or bonus score). Levels are somewhat random, but it still feels like doing the same level again and again.",
    "reviewText": "You are set loose in a dungeon with coins and chests and many many levels. Opening a chest will yield one of nothing, more coins, or something green that hurts you. The goal isn't really clear, but I guess its open chests until you die since that's the only end condition. There is a sweet spot a certain distance away from chests where you can be close enough to open the chest, but not close enough to pick up the hurting things... So your options are to dive senslessly or survive opening chests for as long as your patience can hold out. For any type of challenge I guess you could try killing yourself with the least coins you can pick up, but that seems to go against the apparent goal of get rich or die tryin.\n    This game plays smooth and looks fine. There aren't any big bugs messing with the experience, but that experience is very limited. The basic play is to walk around the levels picking up hearts and coins. The only interesting choice is whether to open one of the treasure chests. The color of the chest tells you the level of risk/reward. Some you'll pretty much always want to open, some you never do, but none of them are always good or always bad. The problem is you don't really have to open them at all. And it's also easy to calculate the risk so that you just never die. So then you end up just running through the levels picking up any loose coins and hearts you see laying about, perhaps a few safe chests now and again, and keep descending. There doesn't seem to be an end to the game, and nothing seems to change level to level. It doesn't get harder, or easier, the level just gets shuffled. So then you get to asking yourself, is this a game at all? If you can't really win, and losing is trivially easy to avoid, what's the point? High score? A high score game has to end at some point, the player has to have a stopping point at which to count up the score. Perhaps if the game had only 5 levels, and you take your high score after 5 levels. Then press your luck trying to beat your high score. As it is I like the ideas, but it didn't come together in the end.\n    A game where you walk through a maze filled with chests (with FPP). Chests may contain gold, or may kill you. That's basically it."

There were only four levels, with premade puzzles, which were neither interesting nor challenging.\n    Written in gamecake, it needs messing about with browser settings in Chrome to work (the exec download wouldn't operate for me). It's an adventure game essentially, picking up items and applying them in set situations to solve puzzles. But with few items or puzzles it lacks any depth, and for a MacGuyver themed game there's no MacGuyver feel to the play - items just get used automatically and you don't have to specially place them or use them in any way. The writing and humour are good though."

I get the impression the 7 days were mostly spent on getting an island generator and working the funky display (which I don't personally like).

The interface kind of gets in the way though.  There are three map views: walls-and-corridors, oxygen levels, and temperature; and you have to switch between them to strategize about how to proceed.  All of the information in those views is coded as redness, and I think it would be possible to combine them somehow into a single view.  The game basically works as advertized; although I kept starting inside a wall, that was the only real bug I ran into.  At low oxygen levels, the squares farther away start freaking out, and it took me a while to determine that this was a feature and not a bug.  And as a feature, I like it a lot, because it impairs your ability to plan a path.  But a message saying what was happening would have been helpful.  This game grew on me as I learned what was going on, and as I developed a working strategy.  An interface overhaul and a few more features would go a long way toward improving this game.  (Ideas: an axe pickup that lets you break walls in one turn; a fire extinguisher that lets you put out 1-3 fires before running out.)\n    I don't think that this game implements it's idea to the fullest. Or anywhere close. It could be used as a starting point for something bigger, but as it is, there is not much of a game.\n    A dot walks around random squares, which denote walls and fire (the game is about escaping a burning building). I have escaped."

There's no objective though and the enemies are easily avoided. Unfortunately there's so little content that there's little to stand out about this game. However the weapon is interesting, and it would be nice to see this explored in more depth.\n    An extremely simple and rudimentary top-down zombie shooter.  The enemies do not have any form of path-finding so you can simply stand inside a hut and shoot through the door and they will not be able to get to you.  The basic control and collision detection systems seem OK and could make the basis of a decent realtime engine but as a game you will have seen everything it has to offer after about 5 seconds."

The ideas here could all apply to a roguelike, too -- that's one reason I took it as seriously as I did for purposes of judging, and the game is a good little bit of fun (if you like this kind of thing) so I didn't mind giving it a fair shake.\n\n    This isn't really a roguelike; it feels like a throw-in intended for another game jam, finished later and dumped here for the lack of any real content to contribute.  It has absolutely no relevance to the challenge.

    "at": "1 - Combination of vectorish art and ascii looks odd. Controls are horrible. The only option is onscreen arrows that must be pressed with mouse. To make things worse you sometimes press button other than that under cursor.\n    1 - Has some images and story before the game starts, but not very nice IMO. Controls are difficult either.",

    "rt": "1 - There is totally random terrain and hamlets randomly scattered around.Dragon jumps around randomly. There is some progress bar called 'permadeath'. But unfortunately this doesn't make it a roguelike.\n    1 - Almost no roguelike elements.",
    "reviewText": "The dragon awakened and attacking the kingdom. To win you need to reclaim all hamlets (which are very few). The dragon jumps around totally randomly, so it's just the matter of pure luck if he will or will not attack the castle before you visit all the hamlets. It's more of a technological demo of processing/processing.js than actual game.\n\n    In this game, you have to visit all the hamlets (\"H\") on the map. Your enemy is the dragon, who jumps to a random place on the map each turn, and according to the instruction, you lose if it lands on your castle (I think it did, but I have not noticed anything). I think there is no point in playing this game, unless I misunderstand something."
