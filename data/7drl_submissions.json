They hoped that they might return with enough treasure to each be able to finally retire from the questing game. The trial started well enough but after only a few floors the paladin of the group grew complacent and mistook a trap for a harmless floor tile.

Still, as a 7DRL I think it counts as a success.  I will definitely be working more on it, probably targeting mobile.]\n\nInstructions: It's Flash - click on the link, and click the yellow screen to start (there was supposed to be a splash screen).  To play, click on a monster to run to it, or attack if adjacent.  Click on the statues to activate them.  Click on an inventory item to use it.  Stand on stairs and click self to go down.  That is all.\n\n\nYou have heard the legend of the crazed King Midas, the dungeon he created, and the golem that walks it.  You care little for its truth.  All you know is that in the mountains of Anatolia, on the run after the botched robbery of a Sultan's estate, you stumbled upon a cave, which opened into a vault.  A vault of creatures - some of kinds you had never seen before.  A maze of glistening rooms and doorways, leading deep into the earth.  A vault of gold.  Gold and... something alien.  Some dark but glittering magic lingers here. \n\nDelve into the Vaults of Midas, adventurer, and grasp all the gold you can find.  Will you know satiation and retreat alive, or will your greed lead you ever deeper - perhaps even to an encounter with Midas himself?  [More detailed description at game link.]",

Gameplay will be like a bullet hell/shooter (small collision box), but it will be a fusion of turn based and real time; enemies will only move simultaneously when you move.  To make when you shoot and using the time travel mechanic more important, enemies will only be vulnerable at particular moments in time.  Here are my two big goals for this project:\n\n-Getting the time travel mechanic working.  Maybe I bit off too much by doing a real-time version.\n-Instead of procedurally generating terrain, I will be focused on generating challenging enemies procedurally.  What should make this procedural generation interesting is generating how enemies move through time and making dependency chains.",

You have lost all your equipement, but at least made it to the shore. Explore the land, build a shelter, forge weapons, and defeat the darkness !",

Bonuses add up but there aren't enough meteorites to max both speed and strength.\n\nRivers can be crossed by zombies at any point but they can't swim and will be swept down stream. Seek out shallow crossings for the most control when fording rivers.\n\nAt night, humans are at a disadvantage with limited visibility. During the day, humans actively hunt zombies and have much greater range and accuracy. Zombies can seek shelter in dense forests to make it more difficult for humans to detect and shoot them. Zombies are very vulnerable in the day time. Watch the clock carefully and avoid open spaces.\n\nThe game has been tested in Chrome and Firefox.",

The twist is really that damage is defined for player and mobs by a \"wave\": a visible oscillating wave such that the damage you will do is clear. Items on the board are \"patches\" and will alter the wave of either player or mob depending on who picks it up.This game uses terminology and concepts from the world of audio synthesis. Given that for gameplay purposes the concepts have been changed around a bit and nothing really works like on an actual synthesizer, I expect synth fans to either be charmed by or hate the game; non synth fans I expect will probably be bemused or confused by it.",

Each action requires a different amount of time, both for the player and for enemies.\n * Two ways to clear a level: eliminate all enemies, or visit all checkpoints.\n * Time pressure from the “red alert” countdown clock. When it expires, all enemies will be alerted to your position, and killed enemies will start rising from the dead!\n * 25 enemy types, all of which have different AI, attacks, speed, and sensory abilities.\n * 10 active abilities and 3 passive abilities that help you progress through the game.\n * When the player takes damage, a random ability is lost for the remainder of the level. Abilities are restored and a randomly selected new ability is granted when levels 1, 3, 5, and 7 are completed.\n\nEdit: I fixed two major bugs that would cause the game to crash. These fixes came after the deadline, but I'll hope you forgive me. I'd rather that people can play the game without it crashing, even if it technically means I made changes to the game after the time limit expired.",

The levels stay the same, the mobs respawn, the items and bonuses do not regenerate! So, like, leave something for the next guy, eh?

You travel towards the light and realize its a burning torch; as you reach for it, you notice the crude appearance of your skin. You further examine the rest of your body and realize... you're a walking corpse. \"This must be a dream, tell me it's just a dream,\" you think to yourself. You proceed through the chasm eventually coming upon a rifle resting in the grips of a rotten body; at least it still has some ammo in it. A strange looking statue is visible ahead; you approach it then feel the ground vibrate beneath you.",

    "description": "You need to plan, and plan well! Your character has two modes. The first mode is essentially a \"normal\" mode; you can move around, you can equip and unequip items, you can bump attack. In this mode you're stealthy, but weak - enemies can\nshoot you or rocket you and you won't have much chance to dodge them.\n\nWhen you're in the second mode, \"focus\" mode  you turn into a whirlwind of destruction. You can move multiple times a turn, deflect bullets, dodge rockets, and cut enemies to shreds as you zoom past them. The only catch is that you can't control your character directly in focus mode - instead, you lay out a plan when you enter focus mode which your character will execute.\n\nEntering focus mode has a certain time cost, during which you'll be vulnerable. Also, focus mode won't be so strict that you can't plan - you'll be able to have a certain number of 'instant' moves to reposition, and you can exit out of focus mode if you realize you've made a really bad plan.\n",
