# 7DRL Submission data visualisation

This project aims to perform topic modelling and proximity analysis on the
submissions and their reviews of 7DRL. Data is actively collected with
permission from the following sources:
  * http://forums.roguetemple.com/index.php?board=13.280
  * http://7drl.roguetemple.com/jsp/viewGames.jsp
  * http://roguetemple.com/7drl/2017/

As the primary interest is to create data visualisation tools to browse the
7DRL data, the analysis will be done to generate a conneted network of various
metrics, including but not limited to: similarity, style, and their roguelikeness.

Method of visualisation will follow the authors' style as published at ([Ho et al. 2016](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51392274e4b0f86e34bbf68e/t/58fffc9f1e5b6c2665a93726/1493171379954/Finding+Design+Influence+within+Roguelike+Games.pdf)).
Source code and material will be published at this repository as they develop,
